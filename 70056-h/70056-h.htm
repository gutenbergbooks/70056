<div class="sidenote">1777.</div>

<p class="noindent">Towards the end of the year 1777 every effort was made
by the British Ministry to encourage the country to raise
troops voluntarily for the prosecution of the war then
being waged between Great Britain and her American
Colonies. Liverpool, Manchester, Edinburgh, Glasgow, each
raised a regiment of a thousand men at its own expense, and
several independent companies were formed in Wales. In
this manner 15,000 men were raised and presented to the
State, of which upwards of two-thirds were obtained from
Scotland, and principally from the Highland clans.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1778.</div>

<p>At this time Lord McLeod, the eldest son of the Earl
of Cromarty, whose title had been attainted and his estates
forfeited for his participation in the Rebellion of 1745,
returned to England from Sweden, having attained in its
service the rank of Lieutenant-General. Being well
received by His Majesty King George II, and finding his
influence in the Highlands still considerable, although
destitute of property, he offered his services to raise a
regiment. The offer was accepted, and such was the
respect entertained for his family and name, that in a short
time 840 Highlanders were recruited and marched to Elgin.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[6]</span>
Here they were joined by 236 Lowlanders, raised by Captains
the Honorable John Lindsay, David Baird, James
Fowlis, and other officers, and by 34 English and Irish,
who had been recruited in Glasgow. They amounted in
all to 1,100 men, and were embodied at Elgin under the
name of McLeod’s Highlanders in April 1778, where they
were inspected by General Skene, and approved by him as
an excellent hardy body of men, fitted for any service.
Immediately after the completion of this battalion, letters
of service were granted for the creation of a second battalion,
which was raised in like manner, with nearly the same
expedition and in equal numbers. There is no record
extant to show the different nationalities of which this
battalion was formed, but it is probable that its composition
was very similar to that of the first battalion when
raised. Thus in the course of a few months Lord McLeod
from being an exile without fortune or British military
rank, found himself at the head of upwards of 2,200 of his
countrymen, of whom nearly 1,800 were from that district
and neighbourhood in which his family had once possessed
so much influence.</p>

<p>Each battalion consisted of 50 sergeants, 50 corporals,
20 drummers and fifers, 2 pipers, and 1,000 privates, and
was officered as under.</p>

<p>The uniform of the regiment was red, with the regular
Highland equipments.</p>

<p>It is worthy of remark that, when first raised, there
were no less than 19 officers in the regiment named
Mackenzie. It is probable that the proportion of non-commissioned
officers and privates of that name was
equally large, owing to the fact of the regiment having,
as already stated, been principally raised on the estates of
the Earl of Cromarty, the father of Lord McLeod. These
estates are now in the possession of the present Duchess
of Sutherland, who is Countess of Cromarty in her own
right.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1st bat.</div>

<p>After being embodied at Elgin, the first battalion
remained there some weeks, and then marched to Fort
George, where it was formed into ten companies. It
embarked on the 8th of May, 1,100 strong, under Lord
McLeod, for Portsmouth, where it was to be transhipped
and accompany the East India Fleet. The passage, however,
having occupied fifteen days, the fleet sailed before
the arrival of the transports, which were then ordered to
proceed to Guernsey and Jersey. Here the battalion disembarked,
and remained until relieved by the Seventy-eighth
Regiment on the 27th November. Embarking on
board the transports which brought the latter, it was conveyed
to Portsmouth, where it disembarked on the 10th
December and marched to Petersfield, where it was
quartered until the close of the year. Orders having been
received for its embarkation for the East Indies, a mutiny
occurred in one of the companies, owing to a rumour
gaining ground that the men had been sold to the East
India Company by the British Government. This was
happily checked, by the prompt and resolute spirit displayed
by the officers, and the assurance of their Colonel that this
report was entirely groundless. In January the battalion,
about 1,100 strong, embarked on board Indiamen, under
the command of Colonel Lord McLeod. Three vessels
formed part of a fleet, escorted by Rear-Admiral Sir
Edward Hughes, which in its passage touched at Goree, on
the Coast of Africa, and captured that settlement from the
French. After leaving Goree the fleet proceeded to the
Cape of Good Hope, at that time in possession of the
Dutch, where it landed its sick. It remained there three
months, anchored in Table Bay, and then continued its
course to India. The voyage, though tedious, was on the
whole prosperous, and was brought to a close by anchor
being dropped in Madras Roads on the 20th January,<span class="sidenote">1780.</span>
1780, just twelve months subsequent to embarkation. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[10]</span>
battalion was landed without delay at Fort St. George,
where it remained about a month in barracks, after which
it was removed to Poonamallee.</p>

<div class="sidenote">2nd bat.</div>

<div class="sidenote">1778.</div>

<p>Before following the proceedings of the first battalion
any further, it will be as well to return to the second
battalion, which, as already mentioned, was embodied in
September, 1778. In March of the following year, this
battalion, 1,000 strong, and commanded by Lieut.-Colonel
the Hon. George Mackenzie (brother of Lord McLeod),
embarked at Fort George, and was conveyed to Plymouth.
There it remained encamped upon Maker Heights until
the 27th November, when it embarked for Gibraltar in
transports under convoy of Admiral Sir George Brydges
Rodney. In the Bay of Biscay the Spanish Caraccas
Fleet was encountered, and captured, and the Admiral
being compelled to employ a number of the men of his
ships of war to man the prizes, called upon Lieut.-Colonel
Mackenzie for the services of the battalion as Marines. A
few days after the men had been distributed in this manner,
the fleet fell in with the Spanish Admiral Don Juan
de Langara, with a fleet consisting of eleven sail of the
line, the whole of whose ships were either taken or dispersed.
On the 18th January, 1780, the second battalion<span class="sidenote">1780.</span>
disembarked at Gibraltar, then closely blockaded by the
Spaniards, landing at the New Mole and occupying the
Casemates in the King’s Bastion, the marching in strength
being as follows:—</p>

<p>Here it remained during the whole of the siege of that
fortress by the French and Spaniards, sustaining a high
character as steady and trustworthy soldiers.</p>

<p>In the grand sortie in which the Spanish batteries before<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[11]</span>
the garrison were destroyed, all the grenadier and light
infantry companies in garrison were made up to their
establishment previous to the sortie. The grenadier and
light companies in this regiment consisted of four officers,
five sergeants, and 101 rank and file each. They were
stationed with the companies of the Thirty-ninth and
Fifty-sixth Regiments, and a proportion of artillery and
engineers, amounting in all to 668 men, in the centre, or
reserve column, commanded by Lieut.-Colonel Dachenhausen
and Major Maxwell. The orders they received
were to march through Bayside barrier, towards the mortar
batteries. The moon shone brightly as the soldiers
assembled on the sands at midnight. Between two and
three o’clock darkness overspread the country, and the
troops issued silently from the fortress. They were challenged
and fired upon by the enemy’s sentries, but the
British soldiers rushed forward, overpowered the Spanish
guards, and captured the batteries. The enemy’s soldiers,
instead of defending the works, fled in dismay and communicated
the panic to the troops in their rear. Within an
hour the object of the sortie was effected, trains were laid
to the enemy’s magazines, and the soldiers withdrew. As
they entered the fortress, tremendous explosions shook the
ground, and rising columns of smoke, flame, and burning
timber proclaimed the destruction of the enemy’s immense
stores of gunpowder. General Elliot stated in orders:—</p>

<p>“The bearing and conduct of the whole detachment,
officers, seamen and soldiers on this glorious occasion,
surpass my utmost acknowledgements.” The casualties
in the three columns of attack were only 4 killed, 24
wounded, and 1 missing. The grenadier company, commanded
by Captain Sinclair on this occasion, drove the
enemy from their centre guard-house, and the light infantry,
commanded by Captain Dalrymple, obliged them to
evacuate Parchal’s battery.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span></p>

<p>The casualties of the battalion during the three years
that the siege lasted were 1 sergeant, 41 privates killed; 6
officers, 7 sergeants, and 108 rank and file wounded, and
58 privates died from sickness. Although application has
frequently been made to the authorities, for permission to
have Gibraltar inscribed on the colours, yet for some inexplicable
reason, this has always been refused, though
granted to other regiments that served during the siege
with the Seventy-third.</p>

<p>In May, 1783, it embarked on board transports, and
sailed for Portsmouth, where it landed in July, and occupied
Hilsea Barracks. The following month it marched to
Stirling, where it was disbanded on the 3rd October after a
service of five years, during the whole of which period it was
commanded by Lieut.-Colonel the Hon. George Mackenzie.</p>

<p>In 1784 the officers belonging to the late second battalion
who were regimentally senior to those serving with
the first were given the option of joining that battalion in
the East Indies at their own expense, of which some availed
themselves.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1st bat.</div>

<p>We shall now return to the first battalion which we
left in quarters at Poonamallee in February, 1780. At the
commencement of 1780 a new war had broken out in India,
the causes of which it is not easy to unravel, owing to the
depth to which the several Presidencies of the East India
Company had entered into the intrigues and quarrels of the
Native rulers. On the 5th April, the Mahratta Chiefs,
Holkar and Scindia, were defeated in their camp whilst
advancing on Surat, and this victory was followed by
numerous less important successes. In Bengal, military
movements were taking place under the direction of Sir
Eyre Coote, who had now succeeded to the chief command
in India, and the strong fortress of Gwalior, hitherto regarded
as impregnable, was taken by escalade on the 3rd
August.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span></p>

<p>On the side of Madras the forces on the establishment
did not exceed 30,000 men, dispersed in very distant
quarters, and the Presidency had unfortunately been engrossed
in internal disputes rather than in active measures
of preparation to oppose the enemy. Such was the state
of affairs at Madras when on the 10th of June information
was received that a large army was assembling at Bangalore
under Hyder Ali, the son of a petty chief in Mysore,
who had risen to the chief command of the army of that
State. On the death of the Rajah, Hyder Ali assumed
the guardianship of his eldest son, who was left a minor,
placing him under restraint, and seizing upon the reins of
government. Having a considerable territory under his
control, he maintained a formidable military establishment,
which he endeavoured to bring into a high state of discipline
and efficiency. Standing now in the position of
Sultan of Mysore, he formed a league with the French,
and entered into a confederacy with the Nizam of the
Deccan, the Mahrattas, and other native powers, for the
purpose of expelling the British from India.</p>

<p>In July, 1780, Hyder Ali, having passed the Ghauts,
burst like a torrent into the Carnatic, whilst his son, Tippoo
Saïb, advanced with a large body of cavalry against the
Northern Circars, and even the villages near Madras were
attacked by parties of the enemy’s horse. In consequence
of these events the first battalion Seventy-third Regiment
was ordered to join the army being assembled at St.
Thomas’s Mount under the command of Major-General
Sir Hector Munro, K.B. This army amounted to upwards
of 4,000 men, consisting entirely of the Honourable East
India Company’s troops, with the exception of the Seventy-third
Highlanders, then about 800 strong. It was composed
as follows:—</p>

<p>Attached to these were 30 field pieces and howitzers,
and four battering 24-pounders.</p>

<p>On the 25th August this corps marched to Conjeveram,
about 50 miles west of Madras on the Arcot road, where
it was to be met by a body of men under Colonel Baillie,
from the Gunton Circar, the joint force proceeding to raise
the siege of Arcot, invested by Hyder Ali on the 21st
August. Sir Hector Munro’s army arrived at Conjeveram
on the 29th August, being followed the whole way by the
enemy’s horse. The country here was found to be entirely
under water, so that no provisions of any kind were to be
procured, and the force was consequently dependent upon
the four day’s provisions in its possession.</p>

<p>Hyder Ali now raised the siege of Arcot, and detached
Tippoo Saïb with a force of 40,000 horse and foot and 12
guns to intercept Colonel Baillie and prevent his junction
with the main army. This junction had been expected to
take place on the 30th August, but Baillie being delayed
some days by the sudden rising of a small river, this time
was utilised by the enemy to intercept him.</p>

<p>Colonel Baillie reached Perambaucum, 15 miles from
General Munro’s position, on the 6th September, where he
was attacked by Tippoo Saïb, whom after a contest of
several hours he repulsed. Strange to say, however, the
forces of Munro and Baillie, though within a few hours’
march of each other, made no effort to unite. Two days
after the battle, Colonel Baillie sent notice to General<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span>
Munro to push forward with the main body, as, from the
loss he had lately sustained and from want of provisions,
he was unable to advance in the face of an enemy so
superior in numbers. After this unaccountable delay, the
General sent forward a detachment under Colonel Fletcher
consisting of the flank companies Seventy-third (now
Seventy-first), two companies of European grenadiers, and
11 companies of Sepoys, in all 1,000 men. Of the flank
companies, Seventy-third, the grenadier company was commanded
by Lieutenant the Hon. John Lindsay, and the
light company by Captain, afterwards General the Right
Hon. Sir David Baird, G.C.B. Colonel Fletcher joined
Colonel Baillie’s force on the 9th September.</p>

<p>Reinforced by this detachment, Colonel Baillie set out
to join Munro on the same evening, but had not proceeded
beyond a mile when he fell in with the pickets of Hyder
Ali’s army. An irregular fire commenced, which was kept
up by both parties for several miles, until Colonel Baillie
halted about midnight, when he lay on his arms all night
without being disturbed by the enemy.</p>

<p>He continued his march next morning without opposition,
and after proceeding two miles entered a jungle.
The Sultan had concentrated his army about this spot,
and on the preceding day had thrown up three batteries,
one in the centre of the grove and one on each flank. No
sooner had Colonel Baillie entered the jungle than a heavy
and destructive fire was opened upon him from 57 pieces
of cannon. The march was continued in the form of a
square, with the sick, baggage, and ammunition in the
centre; and though the detachment was assailed on all
sides by an immense force, the enemy after a desperate
conflict of three hours’ duration, was driven back at every
point.</p>

<p>Thus repulsed, Hyder Ali determined to retreat, and
orders had been given to Colonel Lally, a French officer<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span>
in the service of the Sultan, to draw off his men, and to
the cavalry to cover the retreat, when two explosions were
seen to take place in the British line. These laid open one
entire face of their column, destroyed their artillery, and
threw the whole into irreparable confusion. This occurrence
revived Hyder’s hopes, his cavalry charged in successive
squadrons, and his infantry poured volleys of musketry
upon the devoted band. Reduced at length to little more
than 400 men, Colonel Baillie formed these into a square
upon a small eminence. Here, after two-thirds of the
number had been killed or disabled, the officers with their
swords, and the soldiers with their bayonets, repulsed
thirteen charges. At length, borne down by fresh bodies
of horse, Colonel Baillie, to save the lives of the few brave
men who survived, displayed a flag of truce. Quarter was
promised, but no sooner had the men laid down their
arms, than they were savagely attacked, and only by the
humane interference of the French officers were any lives
saved.</p>

<p>One of these officers,<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> speaking of this action says:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Too great encomiums cannot be bestowed on the English
commander and his troops, for in the whole of this trying
conflict they preserved a coolness of manœuvre which
would have done honour to any troops in the world.
Raked by the fire of an immense artillery, the greater
part of the action within grape shot range, attacked on
all sides by not less than 25,000 horse and 30 battalions
of Sepoys, besides Hyder’s European troops, the English
column stood firm, and repulsed every charge with great
slaughter. The horse driven back on the foot, the right
of our line began to give way, though composed of the
best troops in the Mysore army.”</p>
</div>

<p>In this action, known by the name of the battle of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span>
Perambaucum, Lieut.-Colonel Fletcher and 29 European
officers, with 155 rank and file were killed; Lieut.-Colonel
Baillie with 34 officers, and almost all the European
privates, were wounded; 16 officers and privates remained
unhurt, who, with the rest, were made prisoners. The
whole of the sepoys were either killed, taken, or dispersed.</p>

<p>From the report of an eye-witness, it is stated that the
grenadiers of this regiment under Captain Baird fought
with such determination and heroism, that many of them
were seen loading their muskets after their legs had been
shot away; almost all disdained to accept of quarter.</p>

<p>The flank companies were almost annihilated. Lieut.
Geddes Mackenzie and William Gunn, Volunteer Forbes, 3
sergeants, and 82 rank and file were killed. Captain
Baird received seven wounds, and Lieutenant the Hon.
John Lindsay nine. Lieutenants Philip Melville and
Hugh Cuthbert, 4 sergeants, 4 drummers, and 92 rank and
file were also wounded. All these, with 23 who escaped
without wounds, were thrown into a dungeon by Hyder
Ali, where they were treated with such barbarity that only
30 of the soldiers survived, and of these few were afterwards
fit for service.</p>

<p>Mrs. Grant, in her “Superstitions of the Highlanders,”
referring to this in allusion to the inflexible integrity of the
Highlanders under the most trying circumstances, says of
the prisoners:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“They were treated with the most cruel indignity, and
fed upon sparing proportions of unwholesome rice, which
operated as a slow poison, assisted by the burning heat
of the sun by day, and the unwholesome dews of night,
to which they were purposely exposed to shake their
constancy. Daily some of their companions dropped
before their eyes, and daily they were offered liberty and
riches in exchange for this lingering torture, on condition<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span>
of relinquishing their religion and taking the turban.
These Highlanders were entirely illiterate, scarce one of
them could have told the name of any particular sect of
Christians, and all the idea they had of the Mahommedan
religion was that it was adverse to their own, and to
what they had been taught by their fathers.”</p>
</div>

<p>Of the two entire companies but two men rejoined the
battalion, and these were found in the jungle desperately
wounded. In consequence of this, two new flank companies
were formed from the battalion by Lord McLeod.</p>

<p>After Colonel Baillie’s defeat, Sir Hector Munro retired
with the army to Chingleput, being much pressed by the
enemy during his march. The sick and wounded being
left there, the army went into quarters on Choultry Plain
for the rainy season, which had now set in.</p>

<p>During the retreat the troops suffered severely from
fatigue and want of provisions. Captain Gilchrist, of the
grenadiers, whose ill health had prevented his being with
his company, died, and Lieutenant Alexander Mackenzie,
with a great many privates, was wounded in skirmishes
with the enemy.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1781.</div>

<p>Upon the 17th January the army, being reassembled,
took the field under the command of Lieutenant-General
Sir Eyre Coote. At this time the strength of the regiment
did not exceed 500 men, and was commanded by Lieutenant-Colonel
James Craufurd, this officer having succeeded
Lord McLeod, who relinquished his command, and
returned to England, having, it is said, differed in opinion
with General Munro on the subject of his movements.
Hyder Ali was in the Tanjore country committing every
species of outrage and devastation.</p>

<p>On the 1st June, 1781, Colonel Lord McLeod received
the local rank of Major-General in the East Indies. In
June Sir Eyre Coote moved his force southwards along
the coast towards Cuddalore, where his outposts were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span>
attacked by Tippoo Saïb, who was repulsed. He afterwards
moved to Chillumborem, upon the Coleroon, where
the enemy had a large magazine of grain. The Pagoda
was attacked by the pickets under Major John Shaw,
Seventy-third Highlanders, but they were repulsed and
that officer wounded.</p>

<p>Hyder Ali, apprehensive for the safety of Chillumborem,
moved his army in that direction from Tanjore and Trichinopoly,
whilst Lieutenant-General Sir Eyre Coote, with
the view of obtaining supplies from the shipping, proceeded
towards Cuddalore. By forced marches and manœuvres,
however, Hyder Ali succeeded in nearly surrounding the
latter on the plains of Porto Novo, about two days’ march
south of Cuddalore.</p>

<p>About 4 a.m. on the 1st of July, the enemy, whose
force was computed at 25 battalions of infantry, 400 Europeans,
45,000 horse, and above 100,000 matchlock-men,
peons, and polygars, with 47 pieces of cannon, was seen to
draw up in line-of-battle. The British force did not exceed
8,000 men, of which the Seventy-third was the only European
regiment. Notwithstanding this immense disparity
of force, Sir Eyre Coote determined to attack the enemy,
and drew up his army in two lines, the first, of which the
Seventy-third Highlanders formed a part, being commanded
by Major-General Sir Hector Munro, the second by Major-General
James Stuart. A plain divided the two armies,
beyond which the enemy was drawn up on ground strengthened
by front and flanking redoubts and batteries. The
action commenced by an advanced movement of the
English troops, and after eight hours’ hard fighting the
enemy was forced from all his intrenchments and compelled
to retire. The Seventy-third was on the right of the first
line, and led all the attacks to the full approbation of the
general commanding. His attention was particularly attracted
by one of the pipers, who always blew up more<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span>
heartily the heavier the fire became. This so pleased the
general that he cried out “Well done my brave fellow, you
shall have a pair of silver pipes for this!” The promise
was not forgotten, for a handsome pair of pipes was presented
to the regiment, with an appropriate inscription
bearing testimony to the general’s esteem for its conduct
and character. Meer Saïb, Hyder Ali’s favourite general,
was mortally wounded in this action, and amongst the
4,000 killed were many of his principal officers.</p>

<p>The results of this battle enabled Sir Eyre Coote to
reach Cuddalore, his point of destination, on the 4th July,
and soon afterwards the army was moved to St. Thomas’s
Mount. On the 3rd August the force from Bengal under
the orders of Colonel Pearse, arrived and formed a junction
with Sir Eyre Coote’s army at Pulicat, to which place the
army had moved to facilitate that object. The British
force now amounted to 12,000 men; the 1st Brigade, composed
entirely of Europeans, was commanded by Colonel
Craufurd, Seventy-third Highlanders, and had its station
generally in the centre of the line. Major-General Sir
Hector Munro commanded the right wing, and Colonel
Pearse the left. About this period died Major James
Mackenzie, universally regretted by the regiment. His
exertions in the early part of the campaign had brought
on an illness, which terminated his valuable life.</p>

<p>On the 16th August the preparations which had been
actively carried on for the siege of Arcot and the relief of
Vellore being completed, the army was put in motion.
On the 20th Tripassoor was retaken, and a large supply of
grain found there. Hyder Ali’s camp was now at Conjeveram,
and every exertion was made by his detachments
to check the progress of the troops. On the 27th August,
the enemy was found drawn up in order of battle upon the
very ground which had witnessed Colonel Baillie’s defeat,
a position which Hyder Ali’s religious notions induced him<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span>
to consider fortunate. Here he had determined to try the
issue of a second general action, the result of which will be
best told by the following extract from General Meadows’
despatch:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Hyder thought proper to fall back a few miles to the
ground on which he had defeated the detachment under
Colonel Baillie, where he took up a strong position, and,
influenced by a superstitious notion of its being a lucky
spot, had determined, as I was informed by my intelligence,
to try his fortune in a second battle. I accordingly
marched on the 27th, in the morning, towards him, and,
as reported, about 8 o’clock we discovered his army in
order of battle and in full force to receive us, and in
possession of many strong and advantageous posts, rendered
the more formidable by the nature of the country
lying between, which was intersected by very deep
watercourses; in short, nothing could be more formidable
than the situation of the enemy, and nothing more
arduous than our approach to present a front to them.
I was obliged to form the line under a heavy cannonade
from several batteries, as well as from the enemy’s line,
which galled us exceedingly, and was a very trying situation
for the troops, who bore it with firmness and undaunted
bravery, which did draw the highest honour and
showed a steady valour not to be surpassed by the first
veterans of any nation in Europe. The conflict lasted
from nine in the morning till near sunset, when we had
driven the enemy from all their strong posts, and obliged
them to retreat with precipitation, leaving us in full possession
of the field of battle.” The loss of the British
was upwards of 400 killed and wounded, almost all being
native troops.</p>
</div>

<p>There was one circumstance peculiar to this field of
battle, which stamped it with aggravated horrors. It is
described by Captain Munro in his narrative as follows:—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Perhaps there come not within the wide range of human
imagination scenes more affecting or circumstances more
touching than many of our army had that day to witness
and to bear. On the very spot where they stood lay
strewed amongst their feet the relics of their dearest
fellow-soldiers and friends, who near twelve months before
had been slain by the hands of those very inhuman
monsters that now appeared a second time eager to complete
the work of blood. One poor soldier, with the tear
of affection glistening in his eye, picked up the decaying
spatterdash of his valued brother, with the name yet
entire upon it, which the tinge of blood and effects of
weather had kindly spared.... The scattered
clothes and wings of the flank companies were everywhere
perceptible, as also their helmets and skulls, both of
which bore the marks of many furrowed cuts.”</p>
</div>

<p>Upon this spot the army halted two days, and it then
retired to Tripassoor, to secure provisions. At this period
the health of Major-General Sir Hector Munro compelled
him to leave the army, which led to Colonel Craufurd
becoming second in command, the charge of the regiment
devolving upon Major John Shaw.</p>

<p>On the 27th September, near Sholingar, Colonel
Craufurd received the Commander-in-Chief’s orders to move
the British Army to the front. Hyder Ali, confident of
success, made a forward movement to meet it, when a
general action ensued. A detachment commanded by
Colonel Edmonstone, and of which the flank companies
Seventy-third formed a part, succeeded in turning the
enemy’s left flank, and falling upon his camp and rear.
The day closed with the total defeat of Hyder Ali’s troops,
who were pursued by the cavalry until sunset.</p>

<p>On the 1st October, under circumstances the most
distressing and unpromising, but with a hope of obtaining
provisions, of which the army was quite destitute, and for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span>
which no previous arrangement had been made by the
Government, Sir Eyre Coote pushed boldly through the
Sholingar Pass, and after a march of two days encamped
at Altamancherry, in the Polygar country. Here, by the
friendly aid and kindness of Bum Raze, one of the Polygar
princes, the troops were well supplied with every requisite.
The British camp was moved to Pollipat on the 26th
October, and the sick and wounded sent to Tripassoor.
Vellore was also relieved, after which the army, reinforced
by Colonel Laing with 100 Europeans from Vellore, proceeded
to the attack of Chittoor, which, after a gallant
resistance, capitulated. With a view to draw his opponents
from so inaccessible a country, Hyder Ali proceeded to
the attack of Tripassoor, and on the 20th November Sir
Eyre Coote retired out of the Pollamo, through the
Naggary Pass, which obliged the enemy to raise the siege
of Tripassoor and retire on Arcot. The campaign closed
with the recapture of Chittoor by the enemy. On the
2nd December, the monsoon having set in, the army broke
up its camp on the Koilatoor Plain, and the different
corps marched into cantonments in the neighbourhood of
Madras.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1782.</div>

<p>At the opening of the succeeding campaign at the
beginning of 1782, the army did not muster a larger force
than at the commencement of the former year. The first
and most important object in view was the relief of Vellore,
kept in strict blockade by the enemy. The safety of this
fortress was of paramount consequence, being the only
key possessed by the British to the passes of the Ghauts,
through which an invasion of the enemy’s country could
alone be accomplished. The army pushed through the
Sholingar Pass, and by the 11th January Vellore was
relieved and supplied with rice for six months. After this
was effected the army retired, and on the 20th January
arrived at Poonamallee, having lost upon this expedition<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span>
6 officers and about 30 Europeans, with 100 Sepoys killed
and wounded.</p>

<p>The following account of the death of John Mackay,
a corporal of the battalion, in a skirmish with the enemy
on the march to Vellore, is given by Captain Munro:—“For
the satisfaction of my Highland friends, I take this opportunity
of commemorating the fall of John Mackay, alias
Donn, a corporal in the Seventy-third, son of Robert Donn,
the famous Highland bard, whose singular talent for the
beautiful and extemporaneous composition of Gaelic
poetry was held in such esteem by the Highland Society.
This son of the bard has frequently revived the drooping
spirits of his countrymen upon the march by singing in a
pleasant manner the humorous and lively productions of
his father. He was killed by a cannon ball on the 13th
of January, and on the same evening was interred by his
disconsolate comrades with all the honours of war.”</p>

<p>For the first three months of the year 1782 the army of
Lieutenant-General Sir Eyre Coote was retained inactive
at St. Thomas’ Mount, the government of the presidency
being apprehensive for its own safety, whereas a judicious
movement on Porto Novo might have prevented Tippoo
Saïb’s junction with the strong reinforcement of French
troops that had arrived from Europe in Admiral Suffrein’s
fleet, or at least averted the loss of Permacoil and Cuddalore.
At length Sir Eyre Coote, having been reinforced by
the Seventy-eighth (afterwards the Seventy-second) Regiment
from England, was allowed to commence operations.</p>

<p>At the beginning of April he marched in a southerly
direction by Corangooly and Wandewash towards the
enemy, encamped upon the Red Hills of Pondicherry.
The object of the Commander-in-Chief appeared to be to
separate the French from the Mysore troops, for which
purpose he manœuvred between Chitaput and Arnee,
where he had established magazines. Hyder Ali made a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span>
rapid movement, on the 2nd of June overtaking and attacking
the British rear guard, commanded by Lieutenant-Colonel
John Elphinston,<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> Seventy-third Highlanders, who
maintained his ground with great spirit and intrepidity
until the line had completed its formation. The troops
were then ordered to advance immediately upon the
enemy’s guns, and the foe was soon forced across the River
Arnee, and in pursuit several tumbrils were taken by
Captain the Honourable James Lindsay. This officer, perceiving
a battalion of the enemy extricating the tumbrils
from the bed of the river, dashed forward at the head of
his grenadier company, supported by the remainder of the
corps under Major-General Mackenzie, and succeeded in
dispersing the enemy and seizing the tumbrils. The conduct
of Captain Lindsay, although he had acted without
orders, received the commendation of the Commander-in-Chief.
At the action of Arnee the staff of the regimental
colour was shattered by a cannon ball, and the ensign carrying
it was severely wounded.</p>

<p>The army encamped for the night on the field of battle,
and on the following morning took up a position before
Arnee; but a scarcity of grain compelled the General to
retrace his steps towards Madras, and on the 20th of June
he arrived at St. Thomas’s Mount.</p>

<p>In the months of July and August the army made two
expeditions, one to Wandewash, in which it was foiled by
the activity of Hyder Ali, the other for the relief of Vellore,
which was more fortunate, as it succeeded in throwing a
large quantity of grain into the fortress. The siege of
Cuddalore being determined on, the army moved on the
26th August in a southerly direction, and on the 4th September
halted on the Red Hills of Pondicherry. Deserters
reported the garrison of Cuddalore to consist of 800 Europeans,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span>
300 Africans, and 600 Sepoys, who having expelled
the inhabitants, and covered the walls with cannon were
resolved to defend the place to the last extremity. The
failure of the supplies which Sir Eyre Coote had been led
to expect from Madras by the fleet, excited so much
anxiety and disappointment in the veteran’s mind, that a
severe illness ensued, which obliged him to quit the army.
The command devolved upon Major-General James Stuart,
who commenced his retreat on the evening of the 10th
October. On the 15th October, the monsoon set in with
unusual severity, and the army went into cantonments in
the vicinity of Madras. Hyder Ali at the same time
resumed his old position near Arcot. Shortly after this,
Rear-Admiral Sir Richard Bickerton, with a large fleet
from England, arrived in Madras Roads. Considerable
reinforcements were on board, consisting of the Twenty-third
Light Dragoons, One hundred and first and One
hundred and second Regiments, and the Fifteenth Regiment
of Hanoverian Infantry, which joined the army in
its cantonments.</p>

<p>In December occurred the death of Hyder Ali, who
was, however, succeeded without commotion by his son
Tippoo Saïb, to whom he left a kingdom of his own acquisition,
which made him one of the most powerful princes in
India. Notwithstanding that by private information overland
news was received of a peace having been concluded
between England and the other belligerent powers in
Europe, still the Madras Government determined to persevere
in its original plans for the attack of Cuddalore.
With this view Major-General Stuart put his army in
motion on the 21st April, marching by brigades in a<span class="sidenote">1783.</span>
southerly direction. It consisted of the Seventy-third
and Seventy-eighth, and One hundred and first regiments,
a considerable body of native troops, and a detachment of
Hanoverians under Colonel Wangenheim. Brevet Lieutenant-Colonel<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span>
Elphinston, Seventy-third Highlanders,
took the lead with the Fifth brigade, to the command of
which he had been appointed, in consideration of his distinguished
conduct and important services in the field.
Lieut.-Colonel James Stuart, Seventy-eighth Highlanders,
commanded the First or European Brigade, of which the
Seventy-third formed a part, and which amounted to 1,600
men. Colonel Elphinston in his advance possessed himself
of the Permacoil ruins, from whence the enemy’s advanced
parties could be plainly seen upon the Red Hills.
The remainder of the army joined him there on the 2nd
May. About this time accounts were received of the death
of Lieut.-General Sir Eyre Coote, and Major-General
Stuart temporarily succeeded to the command of the
forces in India.</p>

<p>After leaving Permacoil, the army advanced to Killinoor,
and from thence towards the Red Hills. On the 4th
June, Major-General Stuart encamped close to the Pannar
river, about five miles west of Cuddalore, behind which the
French army was descried in an intrenched camp. The
British passed the Pannar river on the 6th June without
opposition, passed the Bandipollam Hills, and took up a
strong position not more than two miles from the south
face of the fortress of Cuddalore, having the right flank
covered by the sea and the left by the Bandipollam Hills.
The enemy, commanded by General de Bussy, had in the
meantime thrown up works along his front. On the 12th
June Major-General Stuart determined to attack General
de Bussy in the position he occupied, and issued preparatory
orders accordingly. At 4 o’clock on the morning of
the 13th June the action commenced by a movement from
the British left against the enemy’s right flank. A very
obstinate and sanguinary contest ensued, continuing without
intermission until the evening, when, both armies remaining
upon the field of battle, each claimed the victory.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span>
In this action the Seventy-third Highlanders highly distinguished
itself, having wrested from the enemy in the
course of the conflict seven different redoubts. The loss it
sustained was very severe, amounting in killed and wounded
to 13 officers and 272 men, being one-half of the number
in the field. The regiment was commanded by Captain
Hugh Lamont. Captain the Honourable James Lindsay,
commanding the Grenadier Company, Captain Alexander
McKenzie, Lieuts. Simon Mackenzie and James Trail, 4
sergeants and 80 rank and file were killed. Captain John
Hamilton, Lieuts. Charles Gorrie, David Rannie, John
Sinclair, James Duncan, and George Sutherland, 5 sergeants
and 107 rank and file were wounded. The enemy’s
loss was estimated at 62 officers, 961 men killed, wounded,
and missing.</p>

<p>The following flattering compliment formed part of the
General Orders issued by the Commander-in-Chief at the
conclusion of the action:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I am also grateful to Captain Lamont and the officers
under his command who gallantly led the <em>precious remains</em>
of the Seventy-third Highlanders through the most
perilous road to glory, until exactly one-half of the
officers and men were either killed or wounded.”</p>
</div>

<p>The British prosecuted the siege of Cuddalore with
vigour, and on the 25th June the first parallel was completed.
On that day the enemy made a sortie, but was
repulsed with considerable loss after a severe contest. The
commander of the party, Colonel le Chevalier de Damas,
was among the prisoners taken. On the 1st July a frigate
arrived in Cuddalore Roads, bringing official accounts from
England of a general peace having been concluded, and
hostilities consequently ceased.</p>

<p>By the 2nd August the British army had received the
supplies, of which it stood greatly in want, and the camp
was broken up, the troops marching to St. Thomas’s Mount<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span>
where they arrived on the 16th August. Shortly afterwards,
the army went into winter quarters, the Seventy-third
occupying the fort and cantonment of Arcot. On<span class="sidenote">1784.</span>
the conclusion of the peace, in March, 1784, Captains
Baird and the Honble. John Lindsay, Lieut. Melville and
about 30 men, who were taken in Colonel Baillie’s affair,
were released and rejoined the regiment. During the remainder
of the year the Seventy-third continued at Arcot,
and was only employed, beyond the usual routine of
duty in quarters, for a short time in quelling a mutiny
which broke out in the native cavalry at Arnee. The
regiment at this period was commanded by Lieut.-Colonel
William Dalrymple. In the course of the month of June
it was removed from Arcot to Fort St. George, where it
was joined by several officers of the late second battalion,
which had been disbanded. Lieut.-Colonel Dalrymple
having returned to England, Lieut.-Colonel the Honble.
George Mackenzie took command of the regiment, which
continued in quarters at Madras for the remainder of the
year.<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p>At the commencement of the year 1786, the numerical
title of the regiment was changed to the Seventy-first
Highlanders, and new colours were received from England
bearing that number, which designation it has since retained.
In March quarters were changed to Wallajahabad
and Chingleput, nine companies being cantoned at the
former and one at the latter under Brevet Lieut.-Colonel
Hamilton Maxwell.</p>

<p>On the 4th June, 1787, Colonel the Honble. George
Mackenzie, commanding the regiment, died after a short
illness and was interred at Madras. He was succeeded in
the command by the senior major, Brevet Lieut.-Colonel<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span>
John Elphinston, who was succeeded in the majority by
Captain David Baird.</p>

<p>During the year 1787 no change of quarters took place.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1788.</div>

<p>In February, 1788, in consequence of some disturbance
or alarm in the Bombay presidency, the Seventy-first, about
800 strong, marched to Madras, and immediately embarked
on board the Company’s ships for Bombay, where it arrived
in April after a favourable passage. It remained here only
six months, when, its services being dispensed with, it
returned to Madras, and arrived there in December. Five
companies under Lieut.-Colonel Elphinston occupied the
barracks in Fort St. George, and the other five companies
proceeded to Poonamallee. Major-General the Honble.
William Gordon was appointed Colonel on the 9th April,
1789, in succession to Major-General John Lord McLeod
deceased. In the course of the year the five companies at
Poonamallee were moved to Tripassoor.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1790.</div>

<p>Early in 1790, hostilities having commenced by Tippoo
Sultan attacking and capturing the lines of Travancore,
the British Government in India determined to support the
Rajah of that country. On the 18th of March an encampment
was formed for that purpose in the neighbourhood of
Conjeveram under the command of Colonel Musgrave.
The force assembled there consisted of the Nineteenth
British Dragoons, the Fifty-second and Seventy-first Highlanders,
the Third and Fourth Regiments of native Cavalry,
the first Battalion of Coast Artillery, and five of Coast Infantry.
On the 29th of March this force moved to Trichinopoly,
where Colonel Musgrave effected a junction on
the 29th April, with the division assembled there under
Colonel Brydges. This comprised the Thirty-sixth and
Seventy-second Regiments, the Second and Fifth Native
Cavalry, and seven battalions of Coast Sepoys.</p>

<p>On the 24th of May General Meadows arrived at Trichinopoly,
and assumed the command: the army consisted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span>
of 15,000 men, forming two European and four native
brigades. These were divided into wings. Lieut.-Colonel
James Stuart, Seventy-second Highlanders, being appointed
to command the left wing, and Colonel Brydges of
the East India Company’s Service, the right; the Seventy-first
and Seventy-second Highlanders, and First East India
Company’s European battalion, formed the Second European
brigade, under Lieut.-Colonel Clarke of the Company’s
Service. The whole of the cavalry in the advance
was commanded by Lieut.-Colonel Sir John Floyd of the
Nineteenth Light Dragoons.</p>

<p>On the 24th May, Major-General (afterwards Sir William)
Meadows reviewed the army, which on the 26th was
moved towards the Coimbatore country by Anatore and
Kidnaveran. On the 15th June the army reached the
fortified post of Caroor, which the enemy abandoned without
opposition. Here it remained strengthening the place
and collecting grain till the 2nd July, when it moved to
Arrivacourchy, where it arrived on the 5th, and, continuing
its march by Tooramboddy, reached Daraporam on the
10th July, where a large supply of grain was found. The
army arrived at Coimbatore on the 22nd July, being
harassed on the march by Tippoo Saïb’s irregular horse.
A halt was made here, and detachments sent to reduce Dindigul,
Errode, and Palghautcherry, upon which service the
flank companies of the Seventy-first were employed under
Captains Phineas M<sup>c</sup>Intosh and James Robertson. In
August the whole of the cavalry and the advanced infantry
had been pushed forward to the Boovany, near to the
Gudzelhetty Pass. Tippoo Saïb, profiting by the divided
state of the British force, descended with his whole army,
and, after a very severe conflict, obliged Lieut.-Colonel
Floyd to fall back. The troops from Coimbatore, however,
had marched to his support, and, on the junction being
effected, Tippoo Saïb retired. The British returned to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span>
Coimbatore on the 23rd September. Upon the march of
the main body, the flank companies of the Seventy-first
and Seventy-second were withdrawn from the siege of
Palghautcherry, and ordered to take post in the fort of
Coimbatore: and on the return of the army they rejoined
their regiments.</p>

<p>The army was again put in motion on the 29th September,
proceeding towards the Boovany by Shawoor and
Coopachittypollum, where the troops arrived a few hours
after Tippoo Saïb had left it. Some elephants, bullocks,
and camels, loaded with rockets, fell into the hands of the
British. On the 4th of October the army arrived at
Errode, the enemy keeping a respectful distance during the
march, and on the 6th it was ascertained that he had
arrived with his entire force at Darraporam, against which
he opened his batteries on the 8th. The fort had no cannon
mounted, and the garrison, consisting of 100 Europeans
and 200 Sepoys, capitulated on honourable terms, which
were strictly adhered to. The British army moved on the
5th October, and on the 15th encamped in the neighbourhood
of Coimbatore, where Lieut.-Colonel Stuart joined
from Palghautcherry, after having taken that place, and left
it in a tolerable state of defence. On the 20th October, all
the heavy baggage having been deposited in the fort of
Coimbatore, the army marched towards Errode, by Avinochy
and Perentore, where it arrived on the 2nd November.
On the 8th the army proceeded in the direction of
Bovancore, and thence to a ford about three miles below
Errode, the whole crossing the Cavery on the 9th and 10th,
while Tippoo Saïb moved his entire force against a division
under the orders of Lieut.-Colonel Maxwell, Seventy-fourth
Regiment, then in the Bharamahl country. On the 11th
November the army moved by Saukerrydroog on the
Tappoor Pass, and ascended on the 14th, encamping at
Adomancettah in the Bharamahl country: it marched<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span>
again on the 15th, and effected its junction with Lieut.-Colonel
Maxwell at Darampoury on the 17th. The whole
force was now divided into ten brigades. The Seventy-fourth
Highlanders joined the Seventy-first and Seventy-second
in the Second Brigade; and Lieut.-Colonel Maxwell
assumed command of the left wing in place of Colonel
Brydges, who was appointed to command at Trichinopoly.</p>

<p>It was now ascertained that the enemy, whose movements
were always sudden, varied, and perplexing, was
directing his course to the Carnatic by Namacul and
Trichinopoly. The British, in consequence, pursued by
Malusundrum, arriving on the 23rd at Vavoor, the 27th at
Jaloor, the 6th December at Munsarapett, at Terany on
the last day of the year, and the 12th January, 1791, at<span class="sidenote">1791.</span>
Arnee. During this long and fatiguing march, the Anglo-Indian
troops frequently encamped upon the ground from
which the enemy had removed in the morning, but the
efforts made to overtake him were unsuccessful. The
heavy guns and the sick having been left in the fort of
Arnee, the army proceeded to Velhout, where on the 29th
January it was reviewed by General Charles the Earl
Cornwallis, K.G., who had arrived from Bengal to assume
command, and who expressed great satisfaction at the appearance
of the troops. His Lordship was at this period
Governor-General and Commander-in-Chief in the East
Indies. In the course of the foregoing campaign the
Seventy-first lost few men in action, but many fell victims
to climate and fatigue.</p>

<p>The army, being refreshed and equipped, commenced
moving in a westerly direction on the 5th February, and passing
by Perambaukum and Sholingar, arrived on the 11th in
the vicinity of Vellore. On the 14th it marched by Chittipet
and Chittoor towards the Muglee Pass, which it reached
on the 17th. The following day the advance, followed by
the park and stores, ascended the Ghauts, the whole army<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span>
encamping on the 19th at Palamnaire, in the Mysore
country, without having seen anything of the enemy.
During the time the British army remained at Velhout
Tippoo Saïb pushed southward and summoned Cuddalore,
but upon hearing in what direction Earl Cornwallis had
moved the Sultan hastened to the Shangana Pass, where he
arrived too late to oppose the troops at the Muglee Pass.
On the 24th the British marched to Colar, which was
abandoned on their approach, and the army moved on to
Ouscotta, which was carried by a battalion of sepoys.
The enemy displayed a part of his force on the 4th March,
and on the following day opened a cannonade upon the
troops moving towards Bangalore, whilst his horse attempted
to seize the stores and baggage, but without
success. About sunset on the 5th March the army encamped
within shot of the fort of Bangalore. The day
following the suburbs of the town were attacked by the
Thirty-sixth and Seventy-sixth Regiments, with some battalions
of sepoys, and carried after a very resolute resistance
on the part of the defenders. From this period to the
14th March nothing material occurred, but every preparation
for the approaching siege was carried on with diligence
and activity. On the 15th, the batteries being
completed, opened fire upon Bangalore, and on the 17th
the lines were cannonaded by the enemy, while at night
the camp was much disturbed by his rockets. Forage became
very scarce, and none could be procured beyond the
advanced pickets. The siege, however, proceeded, the
enemy continuing to harass the besiegers until the 21st
March, when the breach being considered practicable, an
attack was ordered. The storming party consisted of the
grenadiers of the European regiments, followed by their
light companies, and led by Lieutenant James Duncan,
Seventy-first Highlanders, and Lieutenant John Evans,
Fifty-second Regiment, with a forlorn hope of thirty chosen<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[35]</span>
men, the whole supported by the battalion companies of
the Thirty-sixth, Seventy-second, and Seventy-sixth Regiments,
with some battalions of Bengal sepoys. The attacking
force was commanded by Lieut.-Colonel Maxwell,
Seventy-fourth Highlanders, the flankers by Major Kelly;
Major-General Meadows was present on the occasion. The
grenadier company, Seventy-first Highlanders, was commanded
by Captain the Honourable John Lindsay, who,
upon entering the breach, directed his men to throw away
their priming and trust entirely to their bayonets. The
light company was commanded by Captain James Robertson,
son of the celebrated historian. With the aid of
scaling ladders, and after encountering very formidable
obstacles, Bangalore was carried. From the 6th March to
the capture of Bangalore the Seventy-first had 6 privates
killed and 14 wounded. On the 28th March, a strong garrison
being left in Bangalore, the army moved to Deonhully,
the birthplace of Hyder Ali, where it arrived on the 30th,
and on the 1st April at Chinnaballaporam, both of which
places were abandoned by the enemy. The army reached
Connapelly on the 12th April, and on the following day
effected a junction with the Nizam’s force, which had been
sent to co-operate with the British, and which amounted to
about 15,000 cavalry. On the 18th April the army arrived
at Venkatagherry, where a large detachment of Europeans,
under Colonel Oldham, joined from the Carnatic, and on
the 22nd April it again encamped near Bangalore. During
this march, the object of which was chiefly to secure supplies,
the enemy’s irregular horse were now and then seen
in small detached bodies. On the 4th May the army
marched towards Seringapatam, the capital of Tippoo
Saïb’s territory, and on the 13th reached Arakerry, on
the Cavery, about eight miles below Seringapatam. The
enemy could be seen in front, with their right resting on
the river, and their left on a high hill named the Carighaut.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span>
During the night of the 14th of May the troops
marched with a view to surprising the enemy, but owing
to the badness of the weather and roads, together with the
jaded state of the gun bullocks, little or no progress was
made during the night, but on the following day, after undergoing
great fatigue, they were brought into action. The
enemy was then soon driven from his strong position, and
forced across the river to the island upon which the capital,
Seringapatam, is situated, where he was protected by his
batteries. In this affair four guns and several standards
were taken. The Seventy-first lost Lieutenant and Adjutant
Roderick Mackenzie and 7 rank and file killed. Ensign
John Stuart and 74 rank and file were wounded. The army
rested upon the field of battle, and moving again on the
18th arrived at Canambaddy, on the Cavery, upon the
20th. It was now ascertained that the season was too far
advanced for undertaking immediately the siege of Tippoo
Saïb’s capital, and it was determined accordingly to withdraw.
The battering train was destroyed, all the ammunition
stores which could not be removed were buried, and
on the 26th May the army marched in the direction of
Bangalore. In the course of this retreat the British were
joined by the Mahratta army, consisting of about 33,000
men, chiefly cavalry, and 30 pieces of cannon. Of the approach
of this large force the British had been kept in
total ignorance by the activity of Tippoo’s irregular troops.
Captain Little, with two battalions of Bombay sepoys,
joined with the Mahratta army, and supplies were now
abundant.</p>

<p>On the 11th July the army arrived at Bangalore without
any attempt on the part of the enemy to interrupt the
march. By this time the Nizam’s cavalry had become
unfit to keep the field, and were allowed to return to their
own country. A large detachment of the Mahrattas proceeded
into the Sera country, the remainder continuing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span>
with the British army. On the 15th July the sick and
half of the tumbrils belonging to the field pieces were sent
into the fort of Bangalore, and the army moved towards
Oussoor, where it arrived on the 11th of the following
month. The fort of Oussoor was abandoned by the
enemy after he had blown up the angles.</p>

<p>On the 12th of August the army moved from Oussoor,
and on the 23rd arrived at Bayeur. About this period
Major Gowdie, of the Honourable East India Company’s
Service, was detached with some troops for the reduction
of the strong hill fort of Nundydroog, which it was found
required regular approaches. The flank companies of the
Thirty-sixth and Seventy-first Regiments, under the command
of Captain Robertson of the latter corps, marched
on the 17th of October to join the detachment under
Major Gowdie, and, upon their arrival, were immediately
placed in the last parallel.</p>

<p>On the 18th of October General the Earl Cornwallis
with the whole army, made a movement towards Nundydroog,
and in the evening of that day the troops were told
off for an assault upon the two breaches, which had been
pronounced practicable. The attacks commenced at eleven
o’clock at night, the grenadiers assaulting the right breach
and the light companies the left. The forlorn hope of the
right attack consisted of twenty grenadiers, volunteers from
the Thirty-sixth and Seventy-first, led by Lieutenant Hugh
Mackenzie of the Seventy-first, afterwards for a long time
paymaster of the regiment. The same number of light
infantry, headed by Lieutenant Lewis Moore, of the
Seventy-first, formed the left attack. The grenadier company
of the regiment, in support, was commanded by
Lieutenant James Duncan, the light company by Lieutenant
Kenneth Mackenzie, the whole under Captain
Robertson’s orders. Captain Robert Burne supported,
with the Thirty-sixth grenadiers, the right attack, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span>
Captain William Hartley, with the light company of that
regiment, the left attack; Major-General Meadows, as
usual, animating the whole with his presence. Both
breaches were carried without much resistance from the
enemy, and the gateway of the inner wall being soon
secured, the fort fell into the possession of the British.
Many of the enemy were killed, and several, in attempting
to escape, were dashed to pieces over the precipices. It
was an additional source of gratification that this important
service had been achieved without the loss of a British
soldier. The following general order was issued on this
occasion:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="right">
“<em>Head-Quarters Camp, October 20th, 1791.</em><br>
</p>

<p>“Lord Cornwallis having been witness of the extraordinary
obstacles, both of nature and art, which were
opposed to the detachment of the army that attacked
Nundydroog, he cannot too highly applaud the firmness
and exertions which were manifested by all ranks in carrying
on the operations of the siege, or the valour and
discipline which were displayed by the flank companies
of His Majesty’s Thirty-sixth and Seventy-first Regiments
(other regiments of native infantry were here
enumerated) that were employed in the assault last night,
and which, by overcoming all difficulties, effected the reduction
of that important fort, and he particularly desires
that his warmest thanks may be presented to Captain
Robertson of the Seventy-first Regiment, who commanded
the flank companies that led the assaults.”</p>
</div>

<p>In a few days subsequently to the fall of Nundydroog
the army retraced its route to Bangalore. On the 4th of
December the troops were again put in movement, directing
their march towards Savendroog, a fortress situated on
the side of a mountain surrounded by almost inaccessible
rocks. The fort being reconnoitred, a detachment, under<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span>
Lieut.-Colonel James Stuart of the Seventy-second Regiment,
was selected and ordered to reduce the place. On
the 17th the British were enabled to open upon the fort a
battery of six 18-pounders and three 12-pounders with
considerable effect. The flank companies of the Seventy-first
and Seventy-sixth Regiments joined the detachment
under Lieut.-Colonel Stuart on the 20th of December, and
on the following day the flank companies of the Fifty-second,
Seventy-first, Seventy-second, and Seventy-sixth
were selected for the attack upon Savendroog, in which a
practicable breach had been effected, and formed under
Lieut.-Colonel Colebrook Nesbitt, of the Fifty-second
Regiment. The storming party, commanded by Lieut.-Colonel
Nesbitt, was directed to four different attacks:
Captain James Gage, with the grenadiers of the Fifty-second
and flank companies of the Seventy-sixth Regiments,
to gain the eastern hill to the left; Captain the
Hon. John Lindsay and Captain James Robertson, with
the flank companies of the Seventy-first, to separate and
attack the works or parties they might discover in the
chasm or hollow between the hills; the Fifty-second and
Seventy-second Regiments were to follow the flank companies.
Parties were detached under Lieut.-Colonel Baird
and Major Petrie round the mountain to draw the attention
of the enemy from the main object, and to endeavour
to prevent his escape. At eleven o’clock in the morning
of the 21st of December, on a signal of two guns being
fired from the batteries, the flank companies, in the order
described, followed by the Fifty-second and Seventy-second
Regiments, advanced to the assaults, the band of
the Fifty-second playing “Britons, strike home,” while the
grenadiers and light infantry mounted the breach. Immediate
success followed the attempt, the fort being carried
without the loss of a man. The troops were thanked in
general orders for their gallant conduct, as follows:—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Lord Cornwallis thinks himself fortunate, almost
beyond example, in having acquired by assault a fortress
of so much strength and reputation, and of such inestimable
value to the public interest as Savendroog, without
having to regret the loss of a single soldier....
Although the resistance was so contemptible, he is not
the less sensible that the behaviour of the grenadiers
and light infantry of the Fifty-second, Seventy-first,
Seventy-second, and Seventy-sixth Regiments, who led
the assaults, and who must have made the decisive
impression upon the minds of the enemy, reflects the most
distinguished honour upon their discipline and valour.”</p>
</div>

<p>Outredroog, Ram Gurry, and Sheria Gurry shortly
afterwards surrendered to the British Army. The force
subsequently moved towards Outredroog, a hill fort about
thirty miles west of Bangalore, where a general hospital
was established. On the 31st of January, 1792, the army,<span class="sidenote">1792.</span>
under General the Earl Cornwallis, was reviewed by the
Poonah and Hyderabad Chiefs, and on the following day
commenced its march towards Seringapatam, passing by
Hooleadroog, Tagilly, and Carrycode. The troops came
in sight of Tippoo’s capital on the 3rd of February, and
encamped at the French Rocks. The enemy’s horse
showed itself on the 4th and 5th, but attempted nothing
hostile.</p>

<p>The entrenched camp of Tippoo Saïb was reconnoitred
on the 6th of February, and at dark the army was formed
in three columns of attack. The right, under Major-General
Meadows, consisting of the Thirty-sixth and Seventy-sixth
King’s Regiments; the centre, under the Commander-in-Chief,
General the Earl Cornwallis, consisting of the Fifty-second,
Seventy-first, and Seventy-fourth King’s Regiments.
The left, under Lieut.-Colonel Maxwell, of the Seventy-fourth,
was composed of the Seventy-second Regiment.
The native troops were divided among the three columns.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41]</span>
By eight o’clock in the evening of the 6th of February, the
three columns were in motion. The head of the centre
column, led by the flank companies of the respective
corps, after twice crossing the Sohany river, which covered
the enemy’s right wing and front, came in contact with his
first line, and immediately forced its way through it. The
British flankers, mixing with the fugitives, crossed the north
branch of the Cavery, at the foot of the glacis of the fort of
Seringapatam. Captain the Honourable John Lindsay
collected the grenadiers of the Seventy-first upon the
glacis, and attempted to push into the body of the place,
but was prevented by the bridge being raised a few
moments before he reached it. He was soon after joined
by some of the light company of the Fifty-second and
grenadiers of the Seventy-sixth, with whom he forced his
way down to the famous “Lal bagh,” or Ruby Garden,
where he was attacked most furiously, but the enemy
was repelled with the bayonet.</p>

<p>Captain Lindsay was afterwards joined by the Seventy-fourth
grenadiers, and attempted to drive the enemy from
the Pettah, but could not succeed, from the numbers
which poured on him from all sides. This gallant officer
then took post in a redoubt, where he maintained himself
until morning, and then moved to the north bank of the
river, where the firing appeared very heavy. He was
there met by Brevet Lieutenant-Colonel the Honourable
John Knox, of the Thirty-sixth Regiment, and by Lieut.-Colonel
Baird, with the grenadiers of the Fifty-second and
the light company of the Seventy-first, together with some
of the troops that composed the left attack.</p>

<p>During these occurrences the battalion companies of
the Fifty-second, Seventy-first, and Seventy-second Regiments
forced their way across the river to the island, overpowering
all that opposed them, when Captain Archdeacon,
commanding a battalion of Bengal sepoys, being killed,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[42]</span>
that battalion was thrown into confusion, falling back upon
the Seventy-first. Major Stair Park Dalrymple, wishing
to prevent the sepoys intermingling with his men, ordered
the regiment to move obliquely to the left, an operation
that by chance brought him in contact with the Sultan’s
redoubt, which was instantly attacked and carried. The
charge of the redoubt was given to Captain Hugh Sibbald,
of the Seventy-first, with his company, who on the following
morning was killed, nobly defending it against repeated
and desperate attacks from the enemy. He was replaced
by Major Shelly, under whom the redoubt sustained two
serious assaults. The Commander-in-Chief, General the
Earl Cornwallis, in compliment to the memory of this
officer, had the name of the redoubt changed to “Sibbald.”</p>

<p>In the evening of the 7th of February 3,000 of the
enemy’s horse attacked the British troops on the island,
but were repulsed by the Seventy-first Regiment and the
First Coast Sepoys. In the course of these operations the
regiment had Captain Sibbald and Lieutenant Daniel
Bayne killed; Ensign Duncan Mackenzie was wounded;
about 100 rank and file were killed and wounded.</p>

<p>The enemy’s loss was very severe, being estimated at
20,000 <i lang="fr">hors de combat</i>. Eighty pieces of cannon were taken
by the British. The following general order was issued:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="noindent">“Feb. 7th.</p>

<p>“The conduct and valour of the officers and soldiers of
this army have often merited Lord Cornwallis’s encomiums,
but the zeal and gallantry which were so successfully
displayed last night in the attacks of the enemy’s
whole army in a position which had cost him so much
time and labour to fortify, can never be sufficiently
praised; and his satisfaction on an occasion which promised
to be attended with the most substantial advantages
has been greatly heightened by learning from the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span>
Commanding officers of divisions that this meritorious
behaviour was universal through all ranks, to a degree
that has been rarely equalled. Lord Cornwallis therefore
requests that the army in general will accept of his
most cordial thanks for the noble and gallant manner in
which they have executed the plan of the attack; it
covers them with honour, and will ever command his
warmest sentiments of admiration.”</p>
</div>

<p>On the 9th of February the army took up its final
position for the siege of Seringapatam, and on the 15th
Major-General Robert Abercromby joined with the Bombay
force, consisting of the Seventy-third, Seventy-fifth, and
Seventy-seventh regiments, besides native troops, making
a total of about 6,000 men.</p>

<p>The Seventy-first Highlanders, commanded by Major
Dalrymple, crossed the south branch of the Cavery at nine
o’clock at night on the 18th of February, and two hours
later attacked by surprise a camp of the enemy’s cavalry,
of whom a great part were slain and the remainder dispersed
in all directions. This movement was designed to
cover the operation of opening the trenches, which took
place at the same time within 800 yards of the fort. Until
the 24th of February the approaches were carried on with
the greatest activity, when the general orders announced
that the preliminary articles of peace had been signed, and
in consequence all hostile measures immediately ceased.</p>

<p>On the 26th of February the two sons of Tippoo Saïb,
Abd-el-Khalik and Musa-ed-Deen, the former ten years of
age and the latter eight, were brought to the British camp
as hostages for the due performance of the preliminary
articles.</p>

<p>In consequence of some obstacles which had been
opposed by Tippoo to the arrangement of the definitive
treaty, working parties were ordered, and the guns replaced
in the batteries on the 10th March. This state of suspicion<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span>
and preparation lasted until the 15th of March, when it
was discontinued, and on the 18th of that month, the
definitive treaty being duly executed and signed, was
delivered by the young Abd-el-Khalik to each of the confederates.
On the 20th the counterpart was sent to
Tippoo Saïb.</p>

<p>Thus terminated a war in which the confederates
wrested from the enemy 70 fortresses, 800 pieces of
cannon, and destroyed or dispersed at least 50,000 men.
By the articles of the treaty Tippoo Saïb was bound to pay
a large sum of money and to cede one-half of his dominions.
The Governor-General and Commander-in-Chief in India
granted from this money a sum equal to six months’ batta
for all ranks, and the Court of Directors afterwards made
a similar grant. The East India Company also granted
an annuity of £50 to Captain P. Melville for his services in
India.</p>

<p>On the 26th of March, the exchange of the definitive
treaty being completed, the British commenced moving
towards Bangalore, from whence they proceeded to the
Pednaigdurgum Pass, where the Bengal troops were
ordered to their own Presidency.</p>

<p>Early in May the army descended the Ghauts, arriving
soon after at Vellore, where the Commander-in-Chief
arranged the cantonments of the troops and proceeded to
Madras. The Seventy-first received orders to march to
the southward, and in the month of June arrived at
Warriore, near Trichinopoly, under the command of Lieut.-Colonel
Baird, who during the campaign had been absent
from the regiment in command of a brigade. Eight companies
were stationed at Warriore, and two were detached
with Major Dalrymple to Dindigul. In this situation the
regiment continued for the remainder of the year.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1793.</div>

<p>In March, 1793, the eight companies under the command
of Lieut.-Colonel Baird proceeded from Warriore to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45]</span>
Secundermally, in the neighbourhood of Madura. Meanwhile
the events of the French Revolution had involved
England in another contest, the National Convention of
France having declared war against Great Britain and
Holland in February, 1793. The news of this event
arrived in India in May following, when the siege of the
French settlement of Pondicherry, on the Coromandel
coast, was determined upon. Lieut.-Colonel Baird, of the
Seventy-first, was appointed to command a brigade on this
service.</p>

<p>In July the flank companies of the regiment were
ordered to join the force about to besiege Pondicherry, and
marched for that purpose, being followed soon afterwards
by the battalion companies. The place surrendered on the
22nd of August, and the Seventy-first returned to Secundermally
and Dindigul, where it continued during the remainder
of the year.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1794.</div>

<p>An attack upon the Mauritius was in contemplation at
the commencement of the year 1794, and troops for that
service were assembled at Wallajohabad. The Seventy-first,
having received orders to join this force, marched to
Wallajohabad, where the regiment remained only a short
time, having been ordered to return to the southward, in
consequence of the projected expedition being relinquished.</p>

<p>The regiment marched accordingly, and arrived at
Tanjore in June, where it was stationed for the remainder
of the year, having two companies detached under Major
Dalrymple at Vellum.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1795.</div>

<p>Holland became united to France in the early part of
1795, and was styled the Batavian Republic. Upon the
arrival of this information in India, an expedition was
fitted out against the Island of Ceylon, where the Dutch
had several settlements. Major Dalrymple, with the flank
companies, marched to the coast, and embarked at Negapatam,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span>
for the purpose of co-operating with the troops
destined for Ceylon, under the command of Colonel James
Stuart, of the Seventy-second, who was promoted to the
rank of Major-General at this period. The fleet arrived on
the coast of Ceylon on the 1st of August, and two days
afterwards the troops landed four miles north of the fort of
Trincomalee. The siege of the fort was commenced as
soon as the artillery and stores could be landed and
removed sufficiently near to the place. On the 26th of
August a practicable breach was effected, and the garrison
surrendered. The fort of Batticaloe surrendered on the
18th of September, and the fort and island of Manaar
capitulated on the 5th of October. After these services
were performed, the flank companies returned to Tanjore
in the month of October, having lost 11 men in killed and
wounded. Captain William Charles Gorrie, of the grenadier
company, was desperately wounded in this expedition.</p>

<p>The following honourable mention of an officer in this
regiment is extracted from a letter of Sir Robert Abercromby
to the Duke of York.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="right">
“<em>Calcutta, November 4th.</em><br>
</p>

<p>“I have the honour to inform you that Major Dirom
having resigned his office of Deputy Adjutant-General in
India, I have appointed Captain James Robertson, of the
Seventy-first Regiment, who has acted for him since 1st
July, 1792, to succeed until His Majesty’s pleasure is
known, as Captain Robertson was included in the brevet
of Major, made in March, 1794, though not yet published
in India, and I am sensible any further mark of His
Majesty’s favour will be pleasing to the Marquis Cornwallis,
under whom he served, and I beg leave to recommend
him for the rank of Lieut.-Colonel.”</p>
</div>

<div class="sidenote">1796.</div>

<p>In May, 1796, the regiment marched to Wallajohabad,
where it was stationed during the remainder of the year.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">1797.</div>

<p>On the 2nd of January, 1797, the regiment was
inspected by Major-General Clarke, who issued the following
general order:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Major-General Clarke has experienced infinite satisfaction
this morning at the review of His Majesty’s
Seventy-first Regiment.</p>

<p>“He cannot say that on any occasion of field exercise
he ever was present at a more perfect performance.</p>

<p>“When a corps is so striking in appearance, and so
complete in every branch of its discipline, little can occur
to the Commander-in-Chief to particularize. He cannot
but notice, however, that the Seventy-first Regiment has
excited his admiration for its expertness in those parts
of its exercise which are most essential and most difficult
to execute. He alludes to its order and regularity when
moving in line, its extreme accuracy in preserving distance,
and the neatness and promptitude that are so
evident in all its formations. So much perfection in a
corps whose services in India will long be held in remembrance,
does the greatest honour to Lieut.-Colonel Baird
and all his officers, to whom and the corps at large the
Commander-in-Chief desires to offer his best thanks.”</p>
</div>

<p>The regiment remained in the cantonment of Wallajohabad
until the month of October, when orders were issued
for its return to Europe. It was accordingly drafted, giving
five hundred men to the Seventy-third and Seventy-fourth
Regiments, and then marched from Wallajohabad, under
the command of Colonel Baird, to Madras, and immediately
embarked on board of Indiamen for Great Britain. The
fleet sailed from Madras Roads on the 17th of October,
and was at sea during the remainder of the year. A few
days previous to its embarkation the following order was
published:—</p>

<p>“The officers, non-commissioned officers, drummers,
and privates of the Seventy-first Highlanders are under
orders for Europe, to embark to-morrow morning at six.
The President in Council has much satisfaction in expressing
the great sense entertained by the Government
of the active, zealous, and important services of the
Seventy-first Highlanders during the eighteen years they
have been stationed in India, by which they have contributed
so largely to the reputation of the British Army,
and so essentially promoted the interests of the East

accept of his warmest acknowledgments for conduct
which has been equally honourable to them, and advantageous
to their country. The alacrity with which

<p>Early in January, 1798, the fleet arrived at the Cape
of Good Hope, where the commanding officer of the regiment,
Colonel Baird, was detained upon the Staff, having
been appointed Brigadier-General. After remaining a few
days in Table Bay, the fleet sailed, and reached St.
Helena in February, where it was detained three months,
waiting for a convoy.</p>

<p>The fleet sailed on the 1st of May from St Helena,
without a convoy, and in July, in consequence of contrary
winds, was compelled to put into Cork Harbour. It sailed
from thence for the Thames, and on the 13th of August
the regiment disembarked at Woolwich, where it remained
for a few days, and then re-embarked in smacks for Leith.
After landing, the regiment proceeded to Stirling. As a
mark of indulgence, a general leave for two months was
granted to the officers and men of the Seventy-first, to
enable them to visit their friends and families after the
long absence from their native country. At the expiration
of this period, the whole assembled at Stirling, with the
addition of a few recruits<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>. Immediately afterwards, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span>
whole of the officers and non-commissioned officers, with
the exception of the Staff, and a few at head-quarters,
were sent out to recruit for the regiment.</p>

<p>Very few of the men remained who had originally
formed the regiment; of the officers, the following were
still in the regiment:—</p>

<p class="noindent pad6">
Colonel Baird,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">”&#160; &#160;  Dalrymple,</span><br>

</p>

<div class="sidenote">1799.</div>

<p>During the year 1799, the head-quarters remained at
Stirling, and the recruiting went on but slowly.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1800.</div>

<p>In May, 1800, the strength of the regiment amounted
to about 200 rank and file, when a route arrived changing
the quarters to Paisley, but soon after the march an
order arrived for its proceeding to Ireland. In June the
regiment reached Portpatrick, and crossed immediately
to Donaghadee, from whence it marched, under the command
of Colonel Dalrymple, to Newry, and in a few days
afterwards was removed to Dundalk.</p>

<p>In July the regiment received 600 volunteers from the
Scotch Fencible Corps serving in Ireland, and remained
at Dundalk until the close of the year, when a route
for Dublin was received. At this period, Colonel Dalrymple
was appointed Brigadier-General, and the command
of the regiment devolved on Brevet Lieut.-Colonel
John French.</p>

<p>On the 6th of December Major Denis Pack was promoted
from the Fourth Royal Irish Dragoon Guards to be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[51]</span>
Lieut.-Colonel in the Seventy-first Regiment, in succession
to Lieut.-Colonel the Honourable John Lindsay, who retired
from the service.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1801.</div>

<p>The regiment, early in the year 1801, marched from
Dundalk to Dublin, and occupied the barracks in the
Palatine Square. On the 24th of April, Lieut.-Colonel
Pack joined, and assumed the command of the regiment.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1802.</div>

<p>In March, 1802, in which month the Peace of Amiens
was concluded, the regiment proceeded from Dublin, and
was quartered in the county of Wicklow. The corps was
so divided, that at Arklow, the head-quarters, there were
only two companies. In this situation it continued for the
remainder of the year.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1803.</div>

<p>The regiment proceeded in March, 1803, in three divisions,
to Ballinasloe, where it remained for a few days, and
afterwards marched to Loughrea.</p>

<p>Major-General Sir John Francis Cradock, K.B., was
appointed Colonel of the Seventy-first Highlanders on the
6th of August, 1803, in succession to General the Honourable
William Gordon, who was removed to the Twenty-first
Royal North British Fusiliers.</p>

<p>The regiment continued at Loughrea, but the light
company was detached to Limerick to join a light battalion
which was being formed at that place. Captain Sinclair
died during this year, and the officers of the regiment
caused a stone to be erected over his grave bearing the
following inscription:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“To the memory of Captain John Sinclair, this stone
was caused to be placed by his brother officers of the
Seventy-first Regiment, as a testimony of the high esteem
they held him in as an officer, as well as the sincere love
they bore him as a friend. Twenty-six years spent in
zealous and faithful discharge of his duty justly entitled
him to the character of the one, and the many estimable
qualities of the heart gave him no less claim to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[52]</span>
other; he died at the age of 41, in the year of our Lord
1803, resigning only with his breath that commission
which His Gracious Majesty had pleased to bestow.”</p>
</div>

<div class="sidenote">1804.</div>

<p>In May the regiment proceeded from Loughrea to the
county of Limerick; the head-quarters being stationed at
Rathkeale, one detachment at Newcastle, another at
Tarbert, and a third at Askeaton.</p>

<div class="sidenote">2nd bat.</div>

<p>While the regiment was stationed in Ireland, war had
recommenced with France, and Bonaparte having made
preparations for invading Great Britain, additional measures
of defence to those of the former year were adopted by
the Government; and under the “<em>Additional Force Act</em>,”
passed on the 10th of July, 1804, a second battalion was
added to the Seventy-first Regiment, which was to consist
of men to be raised for limited service in certain counties
of North Britain. The second battalion was formed at
Dumbarton in October, to the command of which Lieut.-Colonel
Lord George Beresford was appointed. Its
establishment was fixed at 23 sergeants, 22 drummers, 20
corporals, 1,380 privates.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1805.</div>

<div class="sidenote">1st bat.</div>

<p>In March, 1805, the first battalion, under the command
of Lieut.-Colonel Pack, proceeded to Bandon, in the county
of Cork, and was stationed at that place until July, when it
marched to Cork, and immediately afterwards to Monkstown,
where it embarked in transports, having been
selected to form part of a secret expedition under its former
commander, Major-General Sir David Baird.</p>

<p>In the beginning of August the embarkation was completed,
and on the 5th of that month the fleet sailed, convoyed
by three 64-gun ships, two frigates and gun brigs,
under the orders of Commodore Sir Home Popham; and
on the 28th of September the fleet, after a very boisterous
passage, arrived at Madeira.</p>

<p>On the 3rd of October the fleet left Madeira, and on
the 12th of November arrived at St. Salvador, in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[53]</span>
Brazils, where an opportunity was afforded of refreshing
the men, landing the sick, and procuring some horses for
the cavalry.</p>

<p>The fleet again put to sea on the 28th of November,
and directed its course towards the Dutch Colony of the
Cape of Good Hope, then in possession of the Batavian
Government, which was united with France in hostility to
Great Britain.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1806.</div>

<p>It arrived at the high table-land of the Cape of Good
Hope on the 4th of January, 1806, and shortly afterwards
came to anchor. The whole of the following day the surf
upon the shore of the bay was too violent to admit of any
attempt to land. Brigadier-General William Carr, afterwards
General Viscount Beresford, was detached, with
such of the cavalry as had horses, and the Thirty-eighth
Regiment, to Saldanha Bay.</p>

<p>In the morning of the 6th of January a landing was
effected by the Highland brigade, consisting of the Seventy-first,
Seventy-second, and Ninety-third Highlanders, and
numbering 2,200 men, under the command of Brigadier-General
Ronald Craufurd Ferguson, in the performance of
which service Lieut.-Colonel Pack, the commanding officer
of the Seventy-first Regiment, was wounded. The following
day was devoted to landing the supplies and the remainder
of the army.</p>

<p>Early in the morning of the 8th of January, Major-General
Sir David Baird formed his troops in two columns,
and moved up to the heights of Bleuberg, from whence the
enemy was seen, drawn up in order of battle, in two lines,
with twenty-three pieces of cannon, his numbers being
calculated at 5,000, of which a large proportion was
cavalry.</p>

<p>The British lines were formed with promptitude and
correctness, and the enemy was attacked with the utmost
spirit. He maintained his ground with some firmness, until<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[54]</span>
a charge of the Highland brigade dislodged and completely
routed him, with the loss of three guns and 700 men.</p>

<p>In this affair the Seventy-first had Brevet Lieut.-Colonel
Robert Campbell wounded. 5 men were killed, and 2
sergeants and 64 rank and file were wounded<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>.</p>

<p>The troops halted for the night at the Reit Valley,
and on the 9th of January the army moved towards the
Salt River, where it was intended to take up a position
previously to the attack of Cape Town, when a flag of
truce appeared from the town, which produced some negociations,
that terminated in its surrender to His Majesty’s
arms. Lieut.-General Janssens, the Governor of the colony,
after his defeat of Blenberg on the 8th, had retired towards
the interior of the country by the Hottentot Holland
Kloof, or Pass, from whence, on the 19th of January, he
signed and ratified the treaty that placed the whole of the
Cape of Good Hope and its dependencies in the possession
of Great Britain, under whose sway it has since continued.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1st bat.</div>

<p>The following letter from Brigadier-General Ferguson
to Major-General Sir David Baird, relative to the regiment
and its commander, is here inserted:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="right">
“<em>Cape Town, 19th January, 1806.</em><br>
</p>

<p>“Sir,</p>

<p>“As in the affair of Bleuberg, on the 8th instant,
chance placed two of the enemy’s guns in possession of
the Highland brigade, I hope you will be pleased to
order the allowance usually granted on such occasions
to be issued and shared amongst the Seventy-first,
Seventy-second, and Ninety-third Regiments.</p>

<p>“Although the guns fell into our hands in front of the
Seventy-first Highlanders, Lieut.-Colonel Pack (desirous<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[55]</span>
that the three regiments should be considered as one
family) has most handsomely withdrawn the prior claim
His Majesty’s Seventy-first Highlanders might have
made, and to which the situation of the guns, when
taken, would have entitled that most excellent corps.</p>

<p class="right">
<span style="margin-right: 11.5em;">“I have, etc.,</span><br>
<span style="margin-right: 2.5em;">(Signed)&#160; &#160; &#160;  “<span class="smcap">R. C. Ferguson</span>,</span><br>
“<em>Brigadier-General</em>.<br>
</p>

<p>“<em>Major-General Sir David Baird.</em>”</p>
</div>

<p>The Seventy-first went into quarters at the cantonment
of Wynberg, about seven miles from Cape Town, on the
road to Simon’s Bay, where the battalion remained until
the 12th of April, when, most unexpectedly, an order
arrived for its immediate embarkation on an expedition
to the Rio de la Plata, in South America, which had been
planned by the British Commanders, naval and military,
at the Cape. The Seventy-first was the only corps of the
Cape garrison destined for this service, with the addition of
a few dragoons and some artillery. At this period the
strength of the battalion amounted to 800 rank and file,
having received some recruits from foreign corps at the
Cape. The troops were to be commanded by Brigadier-General
William Carr Beresford, afterwards Viscount
Beresford.</p>

<p>The battalion was embarked in line-of-battle ships and
transports, and on the 14th of April the fleet sailed from
Table Bay, directing its course to the westward until the
20th, when, in consequence of unfavourable weather, and
having parted company with one of the transports in which
were three companies of the Seventy-first, the signal was
made to rendezvous at St. Helena, at which island the
fleet arrived on the 30th of April, with the exception of
the missing transport. Here the force under Brigadier-General
Beresford received an augmentation of 200 men<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[56]</span>
from the St. Helena Regiment, making a total of 1,087
rank and file.</p>

<p>On the 2nd of May the fleet sailed from St. Helena, and
after a tedious voyage arrived at Cape St. Mary at the
entrance of the Rio de la Plata, on the 8th of June, where
it met with the missing transport.</p>

<p>The troops that had sailed in the line-of-battle ships
were transferred on the 16th of June to the transports,
which proceeded up the river, and on the 24th of that
month came to anchor opposite the city of Buenos Ayres.
The force amounted in all to 1,466 rank and file; the
Seventy-first mustered 784 rank and file. On the 25th,
at night, the Seventy-first, with the other troops, effected a
landing without any opposition. The following morning
they pushed forward, and met the enemy at the village of
Reduccion, who made a trifling stand, and then retired
towards the city. On this occasion Captain Henry
Le Blanc of the Seventy-first lost his leg, and a sergeant
and 5 rank and file were wounded.</p>

<p>The British troops continued to advance in pursuit of
the enemy, and on the morning of the 27th of June forced
their passage across the Rio Chuelo. Some skirmishing
followed this movement, but the city of Buenos Ayres
almost immediately surrendered. In the evening the town
and fort were taken possession of by the first battalion of
the Seventy-first and detachments of marines and St.
Helena Regiment. Major-General Beresford, in his
despatch to Sir David Baird, wrote as follows:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I cannot omit reporting to you that I had the most
just cause to be satisfied with the conduct of every officer
and all the troops under my command; to Lieut.-Colonel
Pack, of the Seventy-first Highlanders, every praise is
due, as well as to that excellent regiment.”</p>
</div>

<p>The Seventy-first occupied barracks in Buenos Ayres,
and remained undisturbed until the beginning of August,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[57]</span>
by which time the enemy had collected a force of about
1,500 men, under a leader named Pueridon, at five leagues
from the city. Brigadier-General Beresford in consequence
moved out with 300 of the Seventy-first, 50 from the St.
Helena Regiment, and six field pieces; attacked and dispersed
the enemy, taking all his artillery, namely, ten
pieces of various calibre. The battalion had only 5 men
wounded in this operation.</p>

<p>About this period a body of the enemy, headed by
Colonel Liniers, a French officer in the service of Spain,
crossed from Colonna to Concher, evidently with hostile
intentions. Forming a junction with the force under
Pueridon, the whole marched upon Buenos Ayres.</p>

<p>On the 10th of August the enemy commenced operations
by the massacre of a sergeant and his guard of the
Seventy-first Regiment, who were posted at a place in the
suburbs where the bull-fights were usually exhibited. On
the following day much skirmishing ensued in the outskirts
of the city, the enemy taking possession of the tops of
houses, from which he kept up a galling and destructive
fire. During this time the main body of the British force
took up a position in the Grand Square, but afterwards
retired into the fort of Buenos Ayres. Being now bereft of
all resources, and having no hope of support, no alternative
remained but to capitulate. At about one o’clock,
therefore, the fort was surrendered to the enemy and hostilities
ceased. The troops marched out with the honours
of war, and laid down their arms in the square. The
officers being granted parole were quartered upon the inhabitants
of the town, and the men were confined in the
prisons of the city.</p>

<p>In these melancholy proceedings Lieut. Mitchell and
Ensign Lucas were killed, and the regiment lost 91 men in
killed and wounded.</p>

<div class="sidenote">2nd bat.</div>

<p>In August, 1806, the second battalion embarked at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[58]</span>
Glasgow for Ireland, and arrived at Belfast on the 1st of
September.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1st bat.</div>

<p>About the middle of September the Seventy-first were
removed from Buenos Ayres into the interior. Brigadier-General
Beresford, with his staff, and Lieut.-Colonel Pack,
were placed at Luxon, from whence they subsequently
effected their escape, upon learning that the removal of the
prisoners still further up the country had been ordered.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1807.</div>

<p>Lieut.-Colonel Pack was thus enabled to join the troops
which had landed near Monte Video in January, 1807,
under the command of Brigadier-General Sir Samuel
Auchmuty, who at Lieut.-Colonel Pack’s request, directed
a board of naval and military officers to inquire into the
particulars of his escape, by whom it was unanimously
approved, and he was declared free to serve.</p>

<div class="sidenote">2nd bat.</div>

<p>The second battalion was removed from Ireland to
Scotland in January, 1807, but returned to Ireland in
June following.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1st bat.</div>

<p>In May, 1807, a further removal to the interior of the
prisoners took place. The officers were collected at a
college belonging to the Jesuits about forty leagues to the
northward of Cordova, and entirely separated from their
men. In this situation they remained until August following,
when, just as they were ordered to prepare for a transfer
to a station still more remote, the accounts of the convention
entered into by Lieut.-General John Whitelocke
were received, by which it was stipulated that the prisoners
should be restored to liberty on condition that all the
British forces should be withdrawn. It is scarcely necessary
to remark that the prospect of being restored to liberty
and friends was greatly damped by the military events
which produced it, and which completely extinguished the
ardent hopes of success that had been entertained from the
arrival of the last British force in South America.</p>

<p>In September the whole of the officers and men were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[59]</span>
reconducted to Buenos Ayres, from whence they were conveyed
in boats to Monte Video, and there embarked in
transports with a view of returning to Europe.</p>

<p>It is a circumstance highly creditable to the character
of the soldiers of the Seventy-first that, although so many
powerful allurements were held out to induce them to
remain in South America, but few individuals were found
to swerve from their duty and allegiance to their King and
country. The Spaniards were very fond of the Highlanders,
particularly of those who were Catholics. One of
these, named Donald Macdonald, overcome by solicitations,
had almost agreed to remain at Buenos Ayres, but
whilst wavering one of his companions sung to him
“Lochaber no more;” the effect was irresistible; the
tears started into poor Donald’s eyes, and wiping them
away, he exclaimed, “Na, na! I canna stay, I’d maybe
return to Lochaber nae mair.”</p>

<p>The fleet sailed immediately, and after a tedious and
rough voyage of three months, the transports having the
Seventy-first on board put into Cork Harbour in December,
and on the 27th of that month the whole were landed,
without uniform, clothing, arms, or accoutrements, and
marched to Middleton under the command of Major Henry
Tolley, Lieut.-Colonel Pack having previously returned to
England from South America.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1808.</div>

<p>In March, 1808, the regiment proceeded from Middleton
to Cork, where its equipment in every respect was
completed.</p>

<div class="sidenote">2nd bat.</div>

<p>The second battalion embarked at Londonderry for
Scotland on the 9th of April, 1808, after transferring 200
men to the first battalion, which raised the strength of the
latter to nearly 900 rank and file.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1st bat.</div>

<p>On the 26th of April, whilst in garrison at Cork, new
colours, to replace those left in South America, were presented
to the Seventy-first by Lieut.-General John Floyd,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span>
who had commanded the cavalry and advance in the campaign
of 1790 in the East Indies.</p>

<p>The following animating and soldier-like address was
made by the gallant General on the occasion:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Seventy-first!!</p>

<p>“I am directed to perform the honourable duty of presenting
your colours.</p>

<p>“Brave Seventy-first, the world is well acquainted with
your gallant conduct at the capture of Buenos Ayres in
South America, under one of His Majesty’s bravest
Generals.</p>

<p>“It is well known that you defended your conquest
with the utmost courage, good conduct, and discipline, to
the last extremity. When diminished to a handful, hopeless
of succour, and destitute of provisions, you were
overwhelmed by multitudes, and reduced by the fortune
of war to lose your liberty and your well-defended
colours, but not your honour. Your honour, Seventy-first
Regiment, remains unsullied.</p>

<p>“Your last act in the field covered you with glory.
Your generous despair, calling upon your General to suffer
you to die with arms in your hands, proceeded from the
genuine spirit of British soldiers. Your behaviour in
prosperity—your sufferings in captivity—and your faithful
discharge of your duty to your King and country,
are appreciated by all.</p>

<p>“You who now stand on this parade, in defiance of the
allurements held out to base desertion, are endeared to
the army and to the country, and your conduct will ensure
you the esteem of all true soldiers—of all worthy men—and
fill every one of you with honest martial pride.</p>

<p>“It has been my good fortune to have witnessed, in a
remote part of the world, the early glories and gallant
conduct of the Seventy-first Regiment in the field; and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span>
it is with great satisfaction I meet you again with replenished
ranks, with good arms in your hands, and with
stout hearts in your bosoms.</p>

<p>“Look forward, officers and soldiers, to the achievement
of new honours and the acquirement of fresh fame!!</p>

<p>“Officers! be the friends and guardians of these brave
fellows committed to your charge!!</p>

<p>“Soldiers! give your confidence to your officers. They
have shared with you the chances of war; they have
bravely bled along with you,—they will always do honour
to themselves and you. Preserve your regiment’s reputation
for valour in the field and regularity in quarters.</p>

<p>“I have now the honour to present the</p>

<p class="center">
“Royal Colour.<br>
<br>
“This is the King’s colour!!<br>
</p>

<p>“I have now the honour to present your regimental
colour.</p>

<p>“This is the colour of the Seventy-first Regiment.</p>

<p>“May victory for ever crown these colours!!!”</p>
</div>

<p>The Peninsula was at this period the centre of political
interest. Portugal, deserted by her government, and Spain
betrayed, the people of each rose in arms to recover the
national independence. Dissensions had arisen in the
Royal family of Spain, occasioned by the sway of Emanuel
Godoy, who bore the title of the “Prince of Peace.” This
Minister was dismissed, but the Court was unable to restore
tranquillity. In this emergency the French Emperor was
solicited to be umpire, and Napoleon ultimately placed the
crown of Spain on his brother Joseph, who was transferred
from the throne of Naples. The Spaniards flew to arms in
consequence. The British Government resolved to aid the
Spanish and Portuguese patriots, and a British army was
ordered to proceed to the Peninsula, under the command
of Lieut.-General Sir Arthur Wellesley. The first battalion<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span>
of the Seventy-first Highlanders formed part of the
force selected on this occasion.</p>

<p>It embarked at the Cove of Cork on the 17th of June,
1808, its strength consisting of 52 sergeants, 22 drummers,
and 874 rank and file.</p>

<p>In June, 1808, His Majesty King George III was
pleased to approve of the Seventy-first bearing the title of
<em>Glasgow</em> in addition to the appellation of <em>Highland</em> regiment.<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<p>In the first instance, the Seventy-first were brigaded
with the Fifth, Thirty-eighth, and fifth battalion of the
Sixtieth Regiment, under Brigadier-General Henry Fane,
and sailed for Portugal, in conjunction with the forces
destined to aid the Spaniards and Portuguese, on the 12th
of July. After a favourable passage, the troops anchored
in Mondego Bay in the beginning of August, and a landing
was effected in the vicinity of the village of Frejus.</p>

<p>Early in the morning of the 4th of August a small
picket of the enemy stationed in the neighbourhood fell
back, and the operation of disembarking the troops was
carried into effect without opposition. The army then
moved on to a position across a deep sandy country, where
it halted and encamped for the night.</p>

<p>At this period a change took place in the arrangement
of the brigades, and the first battalion of the Seventy-first
was placed, with the Thirty-sixth and Fortieth Regiments,
in that commanded by Major-General Ronald Craufurd
Ferguson.</p>

<p>The division under Major-General Sir Brent Spencer,
K.B., from Cadiz, consisting of about 4,000 men, joined
on the 8th of August; and, after a short halt, the
army was again put in motion to occupy a more forward
position, where it remained for some days. On the 17th<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[63]</span>
August the enemy, commanded by General Laborde, was
encountered near Roleia. The position was attacked and
carried with great loss to the French, who retreated to
Torres Vedras.</p>

<p>The light company of the Seventy-first was the only part
of the regiment engaged, the remainder being employed in
manœuvring on the right flank of the French. It suffered a
trifling loss, having but 1 man killed and 2 wounded.</p>

<p>The Seventy-first subsequently received the Royal authority
to bear the word “Roleia” on the regimental colours
and appointments, in commemoration of this victory.</p>

<p>Lieut.-General Sir Arthur Wellesley, after the battle of
Roleia, did not pursue the enemy by the high roads, but,
keeping to the right near the sea, marched to Vimiera to
cover the landing of a brigade commanded by Major-General
Anstruther, which was effected on the 20th of
August.</p>

<p>The morning of the 21st of August was given up to
the troops, in order to prepare and repose themselves. The
men were engaged in washing and cleaning their equipments,
when the approach of the enemy, moving to the
left, was discovered at eight o’clock in the morning, and
the brigades commanded by Major-General Ferguson,
Brigadier-Generals Nightingall, Acland, and Bowes, were
consequently moved across a valley from the heights on
the west to those on the east of Vimiera.</p>

<p>Marshal Junot, Duke of Abrantes, moved on his army
to the attack of the position, directing it on the British
centre, where the Fiftieth Regiment was posted, and moving
along the front gradually to the left until the whole line
became engaged.</p>

<p>A short time previously to this, the soldiers of the
brigade were ordered to sit down, with their arms in their
hands, keeping their formation. The enemy in the meantime
cannonaded the whole line, and pushed on his sharpshooters<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[64]</span>
and infantry. To oppose the former, Major-General
Ferguson ordered the left sections of the companies
to move forward and skirmish. Upon the retreat of the
enemy’s sharpshooters, the action became general along
the front of this brigade, and the whole moved forward to
the attack. Nothing could surpass the steadiness of the
troops on this occasion, and the general and commanding
officers set a noble example, which was followed by all.</p>

<p>The grenadier company of the Seventy-first greatly
distinguished itself, in conjunction with a subdivision of
the light company of the Thirty-sixth Regiment. Captain
Alexander Forbes, who commanded the grenadier company,
was ordered to the support of some British artillery,
and seizing a favourable opportunity, made a dash at a
battery of the enemy’s artillery immediately in his front.
He succeeded in capturing five guns and a howitzer, with
horses, caissons, and equipment complete. In this affair
alone the grenadier company had Lieutenants John Pratt
and Ralph Dudgeon and 13 rank and file wounded,
together with 2 men killed.</p>

<p>The French made a daring effort to retake their artillery
both with cavalry and infantry; but the gallant conduct of
the grenadier company, and the advance of Major-General
Ferguson’s brigade, finally left the guns in the possession
of those who had so gallantly captured them.</p>

<p>George Clark, one of the pipers of the regiment, and
afterwards piper to the Highland Society of London, was
severely wounded in this action, and being unable to
accompany his corps in the advance against the enemy, he
deliberately sat down, and unstrapping his pipes, called
out, “Well my bra’ lads, I can no farther wi’ ye a fighting,
but diel ha’ my soul if ye sal want music,” and immediately
began playing “Up and war them a’ Willie.” He was
afterwards presented with a handsome stand of pipes by
the Highland Society. This is the second instance in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[65]</span>
which the pipers of the Seventy-first have behaved with
particular gallantry, and evinced high feeling for the credit
and honour of the corps.</p>

<p>During the advance of the battalion, several prisoners
were taken, among whom was the French General Brennier,
who surrendered himself on the columns giving way to
corporal John M<sup>c</sup>Kay. The latter was afterwards promoted
to an ensigncy in the Fourth West India Regiment.</p>

<p>The result of this battle was the total defeat of the
enemy, who subsequently retreated on Lisbon, with the
loss of twenty-one pieces of cannon, twenty-three ammunition
waggons, with powder, shells, stores of all descriptions,
and 20,000 rounds of musket ammunition, together with a
great many officers and soldiers killed, wounded, and taken
prisoners.</p>

<p>The conduct of the battalion, and of its commanding
officer, Lieut.-Colonel Pack, was noticed in the public despatches,
and the thanks of the Houses of Parliament were
conferred on the troops.</p>

<p>The following officers of the Seventy-first were wounded
in the battle of Vimiera: Captains Arthur Jones and Maxwell
Mackenzie; Lieutenants John Pratt, William Hartley,
Augustus M<sup>c</sup>Intyre, and Ralph Dudgeon; Ensign James
Campbell, and Acting Adjutant R. M<sup>c</sup>Alpine. Twelve
rank and file were killed; six sergeants, and eighty-six
rank and file wounded.</p>

<p>The Seventy-first subsequently received the royal
authority to bear the word “Vimiera” on the regimental
colour and appointments, in commemoration of this battle.</p>

<p>The <em>Convention of Cintra</em> was the result of this victory;
it was signed on the 30th of August, and by its provisions
the French Army evacuated Portugal.</p>

<p>The British Army was ordered to move forward to
Lisbon, some of the reinforcements for it having preceded
it by water, and occupied the forts at the mouth of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[66]</span>
Tagus. The French Army having by this convention
fallen back on Lisbon, the British proceeded to the vicinity
of Fort St. Julien, and encamped there.</p>

<p>All the objects of the expedition being carried into
effect, and the French troops embarked for France, the
British Army remained for some time at Lisbon and its
vicinity. At this period (September) Lieut.-General Sir
John Moore, having assumed the command, made dispositions
for entering Spain.</p>

<p>The first battalion of the Seventy-first was now brigaded
with the Thirty-sixth and Ninety-eighth Regiments, under
Brigadier-General Catlin Craufurd, and placed in the division
under the command of Lieut.-General the Honourable
John Hope, afterwards the Earl of Hopetoun. On the
27th of October the division was put in motion, and after a
short stay at Badajoz, resumed the march, proceeding by
Merida, Truxillo, Jaraicejo, Puerto-de-Merivette, and crossing
the Tagus at the bridge of Almaraz, directed its route
upon Talavera-de-la-Reyna. From this town the column
proceeded to the Escurial, seven leagues to the north-west
of Madrid.</p>

<p>Intelligence was here received of the enemy’s approach
towards Madrid, and two companies of the Seventy-first,
under Major Archibald Campbell, were pushed forward to
occupy the important pass in the Guadarama Mountains,
which separate Old from New Castile. After a halt of a
few days, the division was put in motion over the Guadarama
Pass to Villa Castin, at which place Lieut.-General
the Honourable John Hope, in consequence of the intelligence
which he received of the enemy’s movements, made
a night march to the left, by Avila and Peneranda, and
finally proceeded to Alba de Tormes. At the latter place
a junction was formed with a detachment from the army
under Lieut.-General Sir John Moore, then at Salamanca.
The army under Sir John Moore was shortly afterwards<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[67]</span>
put in motion towards Valladolid, and subsequently to the
left, to form a junction with Lieut.-General Sir David
Baird’s division, which had landed at Corunna.</p>

<p>Previously to this period, the Spanish Armies under
General Blake, near Bilboa on the left, General Castanos
in the centre, and General Palafox lower down the Ebro on
the right, had been completely defeated. Lieut.-General
Sir John Moore consequently made arrangements for a
retreat on Portugal by Ciudad Rodrigo; but it having
been represented to him that Madrid held out against the
French, he was induced to effect a junction with Lieut.-General
Sir David Baird, in order to make a diversion in
favour of Madrid, by attacking Marshal Soult on the River
Carion.</p>

<p>The British force, twenty-nine thousand strong, joined
at Toro on the 21st of December, and on the 23rd of that
month Sir John Moore advanced with the whole army.
The cavalry had already met with that of the enemy, and
the infantry was within two hours’ march of him, when an
intercepted letter informed the British Commander that
Napoleon, who had entered Madrid on the 4th of December,
was then in full march for Salamanca and Benevente.
A retreat on Corunna, through Gallicia, was immediately decided
on, that through Portugal being then impracticable.</p>

<p>Accordingly the several divisions marched towards the
Esla, the greater part crossing by the bridge of Benevente.
On the 26th of December, after a day’s halt, the cavalry
under Lieut.-General Lord Paget and Brigadier-General
the Honourable Charles Stewart had an engagement with
some of the Imperial Guards that had forded the River
Esla under General Le Févre, who was made prisoner,
with several of his men.</p>

<p>At this period the situation of the British Army was
dispiriting in the extreme. In the midst of winter, in a
dreary and desolate country, the soldiers chilled and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[68]</span>
drenched with the heavy rains, and wearied by long and
rapid marches, were almost destitute of fuel to cook their
victuals, and it was with extreme difficulty that they could
procure shelter. Provisions were scarce, irregularly issued,
and difficult of attainment. The waggons, in which were
their magazines, baggage and stores, were often deserted in
the night by the Spanish drivers, who were terrified by the
approach of the French. Thus baggage, ammunition,
stores, and even money were destroyed to prevent them
falling into the hands of the enemy; and the weak, the
sick, and the wounded were necessarily left behind. The
Seventy-first suffered in proportion with the rest, and by
weakness, sickness, and fatigue lost about 93 men.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1809.</div>

<div class="sidenote">1st bat.</div>

<p>On the 5th of January, 1809, a position was taken up
at Lugo, where some skirmishing occurred, in which three
companies of the Seventy-first were engaged, and repulsed
the enemy.</p>

<p>Lieut.-General Francis Dundas was appointed from the
Ninety-fourth Regiment to be Colonel of the Seventy-first
on the 7th of January, 1809, in succession to Lieut.-General
Sir John Francis Cradock, K.B., removed to the Forty-third
Regiment.</p>

<p>The retreat was again commenced on the 9th of
January, and on the 11th the army, still nearly fifteen
thousand strong, reached Corunna. The British Army,
having accomplished one of the most celebrated retreats
recorded in modern history, repulsing the pursuing enemy
in all his attacks, and having traversed two hundred and
fifty miles of mountainous country, accompanied by severe
privation, was not destined to embark for England without
a battle.</p>

<p>The transports not having arrived, a position was occupied
in advance of Corunna, and some sharp skirmishing
ensued, in which four companies of the Seventy-first were
warmly engaged, and lost several men in killed and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[69]</span>
wounded. Lieutenant William Lockwood was severely
wounded. On this ground the battle of Corunna was
fought on the 16th of January; but the Seventy-first being
placed on the extreme left of the British line, had little
part in it. The result of the action was glorious to the
British Army, but was darkened by the loss of Lieut.-General
Sir John Moore, who received a severe wound
during the battle, and died at ten o’clock on the same
night. His remains were wrapped in a military cloak, and
interred in the Citadel of Corunna, over which Marshal Soult,
with the true feeling of a soldier, erected a monument.</p>

<p>Lieut.-General Sir David Baird, who succeeded to the
command upon Sir John Moore being wounded, was also
wounded, and the command devolved upon Lieut.-General
the Honourable John Hope.</p>

<p>At eight o’clock on the night of the 16th of January
the troops quitted their position, leaving the pickets posted
and a few men to keep up the fires, and then marched into
Corunna, where they embarked for England on the following
day.</p>

<p>In commemoration of this battle, and of the conduct of
the battalion during the expedition, the Seventy-first, in
common with the army employed under Lieut.-General
Sir John Moore, received the royal authority to <ins class="corr" id="tn-69" title="Transcriber’s Note—Original text: 'bear the the word'">
bear the word</ins> “Corunna” on the regimental colour and appointments.</p>

<p>The thanks of both Houses of Parliament were conferred
on the troops, and were communicated to Lieut.-Colonel
Pack by Lieut.-General Sir David Baird in the
following letter:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="right">
“<em>Portsmouth, 30th January, 1809.</em><br>
</p>

<p>“Sir,</p>

<p>“I have great pleasure in transmitting to you
copies of letters from the Lord Chancellor and the
Speaker of the House of Commons, enclosing the resolutions<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[70]</span>
of both Houses of Parliament, dated 25th of January,
1809, which contain the thanks of those Houses to
the army lately engaged before Corunna.</p>

<p>“In communicating to you, Sir, this most signal mark
of the approbation of the Parliament of the United
Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, allow me to
add my warmest congratulations upon a distinction
which you, and the corps under your command on
that day, had a share in obtaining for His Majesty’s
service.</p>

<p class="noindent">“<em>Officer commanding first battalion<br>
<span class="pad2">“Seventy-first Highlanders.</span></em>”</p>
</div>

<p>After the battalion had landed at Ramsgate it was
marched to Ashford, in Kent, where it continued for some
time collecting the men, who, from contrary winds, were
driven into different ports.</p>

<p>While at Ashford the battalion was brigaded with the
Warwick Militia and the Ninety-first Regiment, under
Brigadier-General the Baron de Rottenburg. Great sickness
prevailed at this station, and Surgeon James Evans
and several of the soldiers died of typhus fever.</p>

<p>On the 20th of March, 1809, the Royal authority was
granted for the Seventy-first to be formed into a light
infantry regiment, since which time it has been distinguished
as the Highland Light Infantry.</p>

<p>The first battalion marched on the 27th of April, 1809,
for Brabourne-Lees Barracks, and was brigaded with the
Sixty-eighth and Eighty-fifth Light Infantry Regiments.
Every exertion was here made to increase the strength
and improve the discipline of the corps. In June the first
battalion was increased by a large reinforcement, consisting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[71]</span>
of several officers and 311 non-commissioned officers
and privates from the second battalion, which continued to
be stationed in North Britain. Several volunteers from the
militia were also received at this period.</p>

<p>Immense preparations had been made by the British
Government to fit out the most formidable armament that
had for a long time proceeded from England. The troops,
amounting to 40,000 men, were commanded by Lieut.-General
the Earl of Chatham. The naval portion consisted
of 39 ships of the line, 35 frigates, and numerous gunboats,
bomb-vessels, and other small craft, under Admiral
Sir Richard Strachan. The object of the expedition was
to obtain possession of the islands at the mouth of the
Scheldt and to destroy the French ships in that river,
with the docks and arsenals at Antwerp. The first battalion
of the Seventy-first, towards the end of June, received
orders to prepare for the above service, and
marched on the 28th and 29th of that month in two
divisions, encamping near Gosport.</p>

<p>On the 16th of July the battalion, consisting of 3 field
officers, 6 captains, 27 subalterns, 5 staff, 48 sergeants, and
974 drummers and rank and file, embarked at Portsmouth
on board His Majesty’s ships <i>Belleisle</i> and <i>Impérieuse</i>, and
towards the end of the month sailed for the Downs.</p>

<p>The battalion was brigaded, under Brigadier-General
the Baron de Rottenburg, with the Sixty-eighth and
Eighty-fifth Light Infantry, in the division commanded by
Lieut.-General Alexander Mackenzie Fraser, and in the
corps of Lieut.-General Sir Eyre Coote, K.B.</p>

<p>The expedition sailed from the Downs on the 28th of
July, and having arrived off the Roompet Channel, preparations
were made for landing; small craft to cover the
landing were also sent in shore, and the light brigade,
composed of the Sixty-eighth, Seventy-first, and Eighty-fifth
Light Infantry, were landed under their fire. In an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[72]</span>
instant they were in contact with the enemy’s sharpshooters,
who fell back, skirmishing. Being pushed hard,
four guns, with their equipment and several prisoners, were
taken by two companies of the Seventy-first, under Captains
George Sutherland and Henry Hall, and one company
of the Eighty-fifth.</p>

<p>A battery and flag-staff on the coast were taken possession
of by the tenth company of the Seventy-first, and
in lieu of a flag a soldier’s red jacket was hoisted on it.</p>

<p>This advance having succeeded at all points, and the
enemy having fallen back on Flushing and Middleburg, the
army was disembarked. The advance then dividing, proceeded
by different routes. The Seventy-first moved by
the sea dyke on a fort called Ter Veer, the situation and
strength of which was not sufficiently known, an enemy’s
deserter having given but imperfect intelligence respecting it.</p>

<p>After nightfall the column continued to advance in
perfect silence, with orders to attack the post with the
bayonet, when, on a sudden the advance-guard fell in with
an enemy’s party, who came out for the purpose of firing
some houses which overlooked the works. The column
following the advance-guard had entered an avenue or road
leading to the fort, when the advance commenced the
action with the enemy, who, retiring within the place,
opened a tremendous fire from his works with artillery and
musketry. Some guns pointing down the road by which
the battalion advanced did great execution, and the
Seventy-first had Surgeon Charles Henry Quin killed, and
about 18 men killed and wounded. The column, after
some firing retired, and the place was the next day regularly
invested by sea and land. It took three days to reduce,
when it capitulated, with its stores and a garrison of
800 men.</p>

<p>Flushing having been invested on the 1st of August,
the Seventy-first, after the surrender of Ter Veer, were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[73]</span>
ordered into the line of circumvallation, and placed on the
extreme left, resting on the Scheldt. The preparations for
the attack on the town having been completed, on the
13th a dreadful fire was opened from the batteries and
bomb-vessels, and congreve-rockets having been thrown
into the town, it was on fire in many places. The ships
having joined in the attack, the enemy’s fire slackened, and
at length ceased. A summons being sent in, a delay was
demanded, but, being rejected, the firing recommenced.</p>

<p>On the 14th of August one of the outworks was carried
at the point of the bayonet by a party of detachments and
two companies of the Seventy-first under Lieut.-Colonel
Pack.</p>

<p>In this affair, Ensign Donald Sinclair of the Seventy-first
was killed; Captain George Spottiswoode and a few
men were wounded.</p>

<p>Flushing, with its garrison of 6,000 men, capitulated
on the 15th of August, and the right gate was occupied
by a detachment of 300 men of the First or Royal Scots,
and the left gate by a detachment of similar strength of
the Seventy-first under Major Arthur Jones. The naval
arsenal and some vessels of war which were on the stocks,
fell into the hands of the British.</p>

<p>The Seventy-first proceeded shortly afterwards to Middleburg,
where the battalion remained for a few days,
when it was ordered to occupy Ter Veer, of which place
Lieut.-Colonel Pack was appointed Commandant, and
Lieutenant Henry Clements, of the Seventy-first, Town
Major. The battalion remained doing duty in the garrison
until this island, after destroying the works, etc, was
finally evacuated on the 22nd of December.</p>

<p>On the 23rd of December the battalion embarked in
transports and sailed for England, after a service of five
months in a very unhealthy climate, which cost the battalion
the loss of the following officers and men:—</p>

<p>In passing Cadsand, that fort opened a fire on the transports,
one of which, having part of the Seventy-first on
board, was struck by a round shot which carried off Sergeant
Steel’s legs above the knees.<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<p>On the 25th of December the first battalion of the
Seventy-first disembarked at Deal, and marched to Brabourne-Lees
barracks, in Kent, where it was again brigaded
with the Sixty-eighth and Eighty-fifth Light Infantry, and
was occupied in keeping itself in an efficient state for
active service.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1810.</div>

<p>Upon the Seventy-first being made light infantry, they
were permitted to retain such parts of the national dress
as might not be inconsistent with their duties as a light
corps. A correspondence on the subject took place as
follows between Lieut.-Colonel Pack and the Adjutant-General
in April, 1810:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="noindent">“Sir,</p>

<p>&#160; “I beg leave to state that until I read the Adjutant-General’s
letter of the 31st January last, a copy of which
I have the honour herewith to enclose, I did not think it
possible any misconception could exist as to the Seventy-first
being no longer considered a Highland Regiment,
having myself clearly understood from His Royal Highness
the Duke of York and the present Commander-in-Chief
that in becoming light infantry the corps was to be
put, as to Colonel’s allowances, clothing, and appointments,
exactly on the same establishment as English<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[75]</span>
regiments of the line, being only allowed to retain our
name and such characteristics of the old corps as were in
no way found objectionable, and out of which in point of
‘<span lang="fr">esprit de corps</span>’ much good and no possible harm
could arise, and it was under this impression that the
bonnet cocked as a regimental cap was submitted to the
Horse Guards for approval, and was sealed by the
Adjutant-General for our use. With this security I
should now rest satisfied, but on a point affecting the
honour of the regiment, I cannot allow a shadow of
doubt to rest. I have, therefore, to entreat the Commander-in-Chief
that unquestionable authority may be
given for our wearing the bonnet so cocked, for retaining
our pipes, and still dressing our pipers in the Highland
garb. It cannot be forgotten how those pipes were obtained,
and how constantly the regiment has upheld its
title to them. These are the honourable characteristics
alluded to, which must preserve to future times the previous
remains of the old corps, and of which I feel confident
His Majesty never will have reason to deprive the
Seventy-first Regiment.</p>

<p>On the 8th of May, 1810, the first battalion marched
to Deal Barracks, where every exertion was continued to
render it fit for active service. Here the battalion was
deprived of the services of Lieut.-Colonel Pack, who was
appointed a brigadier in the Portuguese army under
Marshal William Carr Beresford, afterwards General the
Viscount Beresford.</p>

<p>Nothing of moment occurred until the early part of
September, when the battalion received orders to hold six
companies in readiness for foreign service. They were
prepared accordingly by drafting into them, from the companies
which were to remain at home, the most effective
officers and men, several not having recovered from the
Walcheren fever.</p>

<p>The following were the companies selected and completed
for foreign service, namely:—</p>

<p class="noindent">They consisted of 2 field officers, 6 captains, 15 lieutenants,
7 ensigns, 4 staff, 38 sergeants, 12 drummers, and 603 rank
and file.</p>

<p>On the 14th of September the above companies embarked<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[77]</span>
in the Downs on board the Melpomene and St.
Fiorenzo frigates, three companies with the staff, and
Brevet Lieut.-Colonel Nathaniel Levett Peacocke, on board
the former; the remaining three companies, under Brevet
Lieut.-Colonel Thomas Reynell, afterwards colonel of the
regiment, on board the latter. They sailed on the following
day for Lisbon, and entered the Tagus on the 25th of
September, after a short and pleasant passage. The companies
were disembarked on the following day, and
quartered in the San Benito and Espirito Santo convents.</p>

<p>The greatest exertions were made to complete the
companies in field equipment, bât-mules, &amp;c., which being
effected, the detachment marched from Lisbon on the 2nd
of October to Mafra, where it was shortly afterwards
joined by Lieut.-Colonel the Honourable Henry Cadogan,
who assumed the command, and Lieut.-Colonel Peacocke
returned to the second battalion in North Britain. The
detachment being ordered to join the army under Lieut.-General
Viscount Wellington, then retreating before
Marshal Massena, Prince of Essling, marched from Mafra
on the 8th of October, and on the 10th of that month
effected the junction at Sobral, where it was brigaded with
the Fiftieth and Ninety-second Regiments under Major-General
Sir William Erskine, in the first division under
Lieut.-General Sir Brent Spencer, K.B.</p>

<p>The army having retired into a position in the rear of
Sobral, that place was occupied by the Seventy-first, having
for its support the Fiftieth and Ninety-second Regiments
and Major-General Alan Cameron’s brigade. On the 12th
of October the pickets were violently attacked by the
enemy’s advance, and retired skirmishing. In the meantime
the place was ordered to be evacuated, and the pickets
having joined, the Seventy-first took up a position on the
outside, within musket-shot of the town. In this affair the
detachment had 8 men killed and 34 wounded.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[78]</span></p>

<p>In this position the Seventy-first continued, when on
the 14th of October they were again attacked with the
greatest impetuosity, and charged with the bayonet. The
enemy was completely repulsed, with very considerable
loss in killed and wounded, being chased to the spot from
which he made the attack. Both parties resumed their
original position.</p>

<p>In Viscount Wellington’s despatch reporting this affair,
the names of Lieut.-Colonel the Honourable Henry
Cadogan, commanding the Seventy-first, and that of Brevet
Lieut.-Col. Thomas Reynell, were particularly mentioned.</p>

<p>A soldier of the sixth company, named John Rea,
behaved on this occasion in the most gallant manner, and
particularly distinguished himself, for which he received a
silver medal with the following inscription:—“To John
Rea, for his exemplary courage and good conduct as a
soldier at Sobral, 14th October, 1810.”</p>

<p>On the 15th of October the Seventy-first was ordered
to withdraw into the position at Zibriera, which was in
continuation of the lines of Torres Vedras. In this celebrated
position, which bid defiance to the French army,
the troops were constantly on the alert, occupied in rendering
it as strong as circumstances would admit, and in
observing the motions of the enemy.</p>

<p>Marshal Massena did not think proper to attack the
British army in this stronghold, and occupied his time in
reconnaissances and demonstrations, until compelled,
through want of provisions and consequent sickness of his
troops, to abandon his designs, and retire to a position in
his rear. This object he finally effected in a masterly
manner, in the night, between the 14th and 15th of November,
followed by the allied forces. Both armies thus
evacuated positions on which the attention of Europe had
been fixed, and which they had occupied for a month in
presence of each other.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[79]</span></p>

<p>The division in which the six companies of the
Seventy-first were placed advanced by the route of Alemquer,
Cartajo, Atataya, and Almoster, and halted in and
about the latter place from the 20th to the 26th of November,
inclusive. The enemy, in the mean time, retired to an
extremely strong position at and in the vicinity of Santarem,
where Marshal Massena halted, although threatened
by Viscount Wellington, who, after some manœuvring,
took up a position immediately in the enemy’s front,
having his head-quarters at Cartajo, and the different
corps of the army in the villages. The brigade to which
the Seventy-first belonged occupied Alquintrinha.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1811.</div>

<div class="sidenote">1st bat.</div>

<p>At this place the Seventy-first remained in quarters
until March, 1811, at which period the army, having been
reinforced, was about to resume the offensive, when the
enemy retired during the night of the 5th of March, taking
the same road, through Estremadura, by which he entered
Portugal.</p>

<p>The British army accordingly marched in pursuit of
Marshal Massena, and the brigade in which was the
Seventy-first accompanied it, moving by Redinha, Miranda
de Corvo, and Saryedes, passing the Coa, a little above
Sabugal, upon the 5th of April, and on the 9th arrived at
Albergaria, a small town on the frontiers of Spain. The
Seventy-first remained in Albergaria until the 2nd of May,
when the enemy, having been strongly reinforced, moved
off from Salamanca, and on that day crossed the frontier
with a large convoy of provisions for Almeida, then closely
invested by the Portuguese forces under Brigadier-General
Pack.</p>

<p>In consequence of this movement the allied army broke
up its cantonments on the Azava, and formed in order of
battle upon the high ground behind the Duas Casas, the
left extending to the high road to Almeida, which crossed
the river by a ford near Fort Concepcion, and the right<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[80]</span>
keeping up a communication with the bridge at Sabugal;
opposite the centre the village of Fuentes d’Onor was
strongly occupied by light infantry.</p>

<p>Upon the 3rd of May the French took post on the
opposite side of the valley of the Duas Casas, their left
fronting Fuentes d’Onor, and their right extending about
two miles and a half to Almeida. In the afternoon of the
3rd of May they attacked Fuentes d’Onor with much
vigour. That post was defended with the greatest bravery,
until the light companies, being worn out and harassed by
repeated attacks, were obliged to retire, and the enemy
possessed himself of the lower part of the village.</p>

<p>The Seventy-first was now ordered up in support, and,
commanded by Lieut.-Colonel the Honourable Henry
Cadogan, charged the enemy through the village and across
the Duas Casas, taking ten officers and about a hundred
men prisoners. The corps retained its conquest that night
and the whole of the next day, but upon Sunday, the 5th
of May, the French having succeeded in turning some
troops to the immediate right, was obliged to give way;
but having been promptly supported by the Seventy-fourth
and Eighty-eighth Regiments, it again advanced, took
possession of and retained the village until the conclusion
of the action.</p>

<p>A struggle of such duration could not be carried on
without great loss, and the Seventy-first suffered severely.
It went into action about 320 strong, and lost nearly one-half
of its number in killed and wounded.</p>

<p>The Seventy-first had Lieutenants John Conseil, William
Houston, and John Graham, and Ensign Donald
John Kearns, together with 4 sergeants and 22 rank and
file killed. Captains Peter Adamson and James M<sup>c</sup>Intyre,
Lieutenants William M<sup>c</sup>Craw, Humphrey Fox, and Robert
Law (Adjutant), Ensigns Charles Cox, John Vandeleur,
and Carique Lewin, 6 sergeants, 3 buglers, and 100 rank<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[81]</span>
and file, were wounded. 2 officers, with several men, were
taken prisoners.</p>

<p>In commemoration of the gallantry displayed in this
prolonged action, the Seventy-first subsequently received
the royal authority to bear the words “Fuentes d’Onor” on
the regimental colour and appointments.</p>

<p>The following letter from Lord Fitzroy Somerset
will serve to show the opinion entertained by Lord
Wellington of the conduct of the Seventy-first on this
occasion.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="right">
“<em>Villa Formosa, 8th May, 1811.</em><br>
</p>

<p class="noindent">“Sir,</p>

<p>“Lord Wellington being highly gratified with the conduct
of the Seventy-first Regiment, has directed me to
request that you will transmit to me the name of a non-commissioned
officer who may be eligible for a commission,
in order that his Lordship may recommend him for
an Ensigncy on the present occasion.</p>

<p class="right">

“<em>Lieut.-Colonel<br>
&#160; &#160; “The Honourable Henry Cadogan,<br>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; “Seventy-first Regiment.</em>”<br>
</p>
</div>

<p>According to his Lordship’s recommendation, Quartermaster-Sergeant
William Gavin was shortly afterwards
promoted to an ensigncy in the regiment.</p>

<p>The Seventy-first upon the 14th returned to their old
quarters at Albergaria, and remained there until the 26th
of May, when the brigade was ordered to the Alemtejo
frontier, as a reinforcement to Marshal Sir William Beresford’s
army, at this time besieging Badajoz, and threatened
by the advance of Marshal Soult from the south of Spain.</p>

<div class="sidenote">2nd bat.</div>

<p>On the 15th of May, 1811, the second battalion<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[82]</span>
embarked at Leith for South Britain, arrived at Ramsgate
on the 23rd of that month, and remained stationed in
England for nearly two years.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1st bat.</div>

<p>The first battalion, upon its route southward, crossed
the Tagus on the 31st of May, and arrived near Albuhera
on the 14th June, having passed through Portalegre, Aronches,
Campo Mayor, and Talavera Real.</p>

<p>The sanguinary battle of Albuhera, fought on the 16th
of May, had obliged Marshal Soult to retire previously to
the arrival of the reinforcements, which being considered
no longer necessary, the battalion retired to Elvas, where
it remained two days, moving to Toro de Moro on the 19th
of June, where it remained for a month. At this encampment
a detachment of 350 men, with a proportion of officers,
joined from the second battalion then stationed at Deal.</p>

<p>About this period the first battalion became a part of
the army, under Lieut.-General Rowland (afterwards
Viscount) Hill. The junction of the armies of Marshals
Marmont and Soult having obliged Viscount Wellington
to raise the siege of Badajoz, which had been resumed after
the battle of Albuhera, the battalion, in co-operation with
his Lordship’s retrograde movement, retired to Borba on
20th of July. Here it remained until the 1st of September,
when it moved to Portalegre, and thence marched to
Castello de Vido, on the 4th of October.</p>

<p>A detachment from Marshal Soult’s army, under General
Girard, having been levying contributions in Spanish Estremadura,
Lieut.-General Rowland Hill, with a view of
putting a stop to his movements, broke up his cantonment
at Portalegre, upon the 22nd of October, proceeding by
Albuquerque and Malpartida. On the 27th, when, within a
moderate march of the enemy at Arroyo-dos-Molinos, he
halted his troops, and, at night, breaking up his bivouac,
made a flank movement close to the road by which the
French intended to march on the following morning. In<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[83]</span>
that position he awaited the approach of day, when on the
28th of October, the British marched directly on the rear
of the town with such celerity that the cavalry pickets
were attacked before they had time to mount.</p>

<p>The French main body, though in the act of filing out,
had so little intimation of danger, that the officers and men
were surrounded before their formation was effected, and
to seek safety they individually dispersed. Many of them
were killed, and about 1,400 were taken prisoners. All the
enemy’s artillery and baggage were captured. General Brun,
and Colonel the Prince of Aremberg, together with several
other officers, were among the prisoners.</p>

<p>In this brilliant affair the Seventy-first was one of the
three corps that advanced through the centre of the town,
and were, therefore, principally engaged; but the enemy,
from his complete surprise, being unable to make a combined
resistance, the British sustained but a trifling loss.</p>

<p>The battalion subsequently returned to Portalegre,
where it arrived early in November. Although the Thirty-fourth
Regiment was allowed to inscribe the words, “Arroyo
dos Molinos” on its colours, still, for some inexplicable
reason, the same privilege has always been refused to the
other regiments that were present at that action.</p>

<p>Lieut.-General Hill, on the 7th of November, issued the
following General Order:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="right">
“<em>Portalegre, 7th November, 1811.</em><br>
</p>

<p>“Lieut.-General Hill has great satisfaction in congratulating
the troops on the success which has attended
their recent operations in Estremadura, and in so doing
he cannot but endeavour to do justice to the merits of
those through whose exertions it has been obtained. A
patient, willing endurance of forced and night marches,
during the worst of weather, and over bad roads, of
bivouacs in wet weather, oftentimes without cover and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[84]</span>
without fire, and a strict observance of discipline, are
qualities, however, common in British soldiers, which the
Lieut.-General cannot pass unnoticed. Having on this
occasion witnessed the exertion of them in no ordinary
degree, he feels that nothing but the most zealous attention
of commanding officers, the goodwill and zealous
spirit of the non-commissioned officers and soldiers, could
produce such an effect, and he requests they will, generally
and individually, accept his warmest thanks, particularly
those corps which were engaged in the action of Arroyo
dos Molinos, whose silent attention to orders, when preparing
to attack, and when manœuvring before the
enemy, could not but excite his notice, and give them an
additional claim on him.”</p>
</div>

<p>Letters from the Secretary of State, dated the 2nd, and
from His Royal Highness the Duke of York, Commander-in-Chief,
dated the 6th December, were promulgated,
expressive of His Royal Highness the Prince Regent’s
approbation and thanks to Lieut.-General Hill, and the
troops under his command, for their brilliant operations on
the recent expedition in Spanish Estremadura, in having
totally surprised and defeated the enemy, under General
Girard.</p>

<p>Viscount Wellington, having made preparations for the
recapture of Ciudad Rodrigo, concentrated the main body
of the army in that neighbourhood, and the troops, under
Lieut.-General Hill, were therefore ordered to divert the
enemy’s attention in the south.</p>

<p>The first battalion of the Seventy-first remained at
Portalegre, until the 25th of December, when the brigade
moved into Estremadura, for the purpose of expelling the
French, who were ravaging the country. After the performance
of this duty, the battalion returned to its former
quarters at Portalegre, in February, 1812.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[85]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">1812.</div>

<div class="sidenote">1st bat.</div>

<p>Upon the 19th of March, 1812, the battalion moved
northward to Castello Branco, where it remained for about
a week, and afterwards returned for the last time to Portalegre.
The Earl of Wellington having made arrangements
for the third siege of Badajoz, Lieut.-General Sir
Rowland Hill’s corps was destined to cover his movements,
and with that view proceeded on the 21st of March towards
Merida, and afterwards to Don Benito, where the troops
remained for a few days; but upon the approach of Marshal
Soult with a large army, with the intention of raising the
siege, Lieutenant-General Hill retired upon Albuhera,
through Arroyo de San Servan and Talavera Real.</p>

<p>Badajoz having been assaulted and carried by the troops,
under the Earl of Wellington, on the night of the 6th of
April, after a sanguinary conflict, the movement of Marshal
Soult was rendered nugatory, and the troops under his
orders retired into Andalusia.</p>

<p>Marshal Marmont, having, during the progress of the
siege, penetrated into the province of Beira, and threatened
Ciudad Rodrigo and Almeida, the Earl of Wellington,
after the fall of Badajoz, crossed the Tagus, leaving Sir
Rowland Hill’s force to watch Marshal Soult, which took
post at Almendralejos for that purpose.</p>

<p>The battalion was stationed at this town, from the 13th
of April until the 11th of May. It having then become
expedient to render the communications between the
French armies on the north and south of the Tagus as
precarious as possible, by the destruction of the bridge of
boats at Almaraz, the corps under Lieut.-General Sir Rowland
Hill, being the most disposable and convenient force,
was accordingly ordered on this important service.</p>

<p>The French, feeling the importance of this bridge to
their mutual strength and security, had surrounded it on
both sides of the river with formidable enclosed works,
having in the interior of them casemated and loop-holed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[86]</span>
towers. The troops appointed for these strong works, consequently,
anticipated an arduous struggle.</p>

<p>Upon the 12th of May the corps broke up from Almendralejos,
and marching by Truscillo and Jaraicejo, reached
on the 18th of that month the Sierra, 5 miles from Almaraz,
on which stands the Castle of Mirabete. This post
was so strongly fortified that it blocked up the only road
to Almaraz for the passage of artillery, which was considered
by the enemy absolutely necessary for the destruction
of the works. Sir Rowland Hill thought otherwise,
and ascertaining that infantry could cross the Sierra by a
track through Roman Gordo, he left his artillery, and
descended at night with a column of 2,000 men. The leading
company arrived at dawn of day, close to the principal
fort, built on a height a few hundred yards in front of the
<i lang="fr">tête de pont</i>, but such were the difficulties of the road, that a
considerable time elapsed before the rear closed, during
which the troops were fortunately sheltered by a ravine,
unseen by the enemy.</p>

<p>On the 19th May the Fiftieth Regiment, and the left
wing of the Seventy-first, having been provided with
ladders, were appointed to escalade the works of Fort
Napoleon, supported by the right wing of the Seventy-first
and the Ninety-second Regiment.</p>

<p>From a feint made upon Mirabete, the French were
aware that an enemy was in the neighbourhood. The
garrison on the alert immediately opened a heavy fire, and
vigorously resisted the efforts made to push up the escarp;
but the moment the first men gained a footing on the parapet,
the enemy took to flight. The whole of this brilliant
affair was completed in the short space of 15 minutes, and
with little loss. The Seventy-first had Captain Lewis
Grant, with 1 sergeant and 7 rank and file killed; Lieutenants
William Lockwood and Donald Ross, 3 sergeants,
and 29 rank and file were wounded.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[87]</span></p>

<p>The names of 36 non-commissioned officers and soldiers
of the Seventy-first were inserted in regimental orders for
conspicuous bravery upon this occasion, and the Royal
authority was subsequently granted for the word “Almaraz,”
to be borne on the regimental colour and appointments.</p>

<p>The following orders were issued upon this occasion:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="right">
<span style="margin-right: 4em;">“<em>Bivouac, near Fort Napoleon,</em></span><br>

<p>“Major-General Howard cannot delay expressing his
warmest acknowledgments to Lieut.-Colonel Stewart and
Major Harrison, of the Fiftieth Regiment, and Major
Cother, of the Seventy-first Regiment, who commanded
the three columns of attack this morning on Fort Napoleon,
and the works on the Tagus, for the gallant and distinguished
manner in which they led the columns intrusted
to them, as well as to all the other officers, non-commissioned
officers, and privates, for their bravery and good
conduct, which produced the brilliant result of the capture
of the works in question.”</p>
</div>


<div class="blockquot">
<p class="right">
“<em>Truxillo, May 22nd, 1812.</em><br>
</p>

<p class="noindent">“<span class="smcap">General Order.</span></p>

<p>“Lieut.-General Sir Rowland Hill congratulates the
troops on the success which has attended their exertions
in the present expedition. Every object for which it was
undertaken has been attained, and in the manner most
desirable and effectual. It is highly gratifying to the
Lieut.-General to report on this occasion his admiration
of the discipline and the valour of the troops under his
command. The chance of war gave to the Fiftieth and
Seventy-first Regiments the most conspicuous share in
these events, who nobly profited by the opportunity;
but the Lieut.-General is satisfied that the same zeal and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[88]</span>
the same spirit would have been found in every corps if
there had been occasion for bringing them into play.</p>

<p>“The Lieut.-General has not failed to report to his
Excellency the Commander of the Forces the particulars
of this brilliant service, and the good conduct of all those
concerned in it. He will, therefore, not say more at
present than to express his warmest thanks for the
assistance which he has received from all ranks; and he
is confident, when it shall again be his good fortune to
lead them against the enemy, he shall have to report
conduct equally honourable to them and equally advantageous
to their country.”</p>
</div>

<p>The following is an extract from Lieut.-General Sir
Rowland Hill’s despatch to Lord Wellington:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I cannot sufficiently praise the conduct of the Fiftieth
and Seventy-first Regiments to whom the assaults fell,
the constant steady manner in which they formed and
advanced and carried the place was worthy of those
distinguished corps and the officers who led them.”</p>
</div>

<p>The bridge and works in the neighbourhood of Almaraz
having been completely destroyed, the Seventy-first returned
to Truxillo, where they remained a few days, then
moved to Merida, and afterwards to Almendralejos. Lieut.-General
Sir Rowland Hill’s force having received orders to
make a diversion in the south, while the main army was
moving northward on Salamanca, the battalion again
moved from Almendralejos to the borders of Andalusia,
through Llerena. On this march, the advanced parties of
cavalry were constantly skirmishing with the enemy, but
the Seventy-first was not engaged.</p>

<p>From Llerena the battalion returned to Zafra, whence,
after a short halt, it proceeded to Villa Franca, and finally
to Don Benito. In these marches through Estremadura,
the weather was oppressively hot, and, joined to the clouds<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[89]</span>
of dust raised by the troops, was so fatiguing that it was
considered expedient at one time to move by night, and
thus these inconveniences were alleviated.</p>

<p>While the force under Lieut.-General Sir Rowland Hill
had been thus employed, the allied army, under the Earl
of Wellington, had gained a victory on the 22nd of July
over the French at Salamanca, for which he was advanced
to the dignity of Marquis.</p>

<p>From Don Benito, the battalion moved upon the 13th
of September, and passing through Truxillo, Talavera, and
Toledo, arrived at Aranjuez upon the 1st of October, from
which place, after a halt of three weeks, it moved to Ponte
Duenna, further up the Tagus.</p>

<p>The sudden approach of the united armies of Marshals
Soult and Suchet rendered a speedy retreat necessary, and
the division accordingly retired from Ponte Duenna in the
night of the 28th of October, moving to form a junction
with the army of the Marquis of Wellington, who had now
relinquished the siege of Burgos. Near Madrid, the division
halted for a short period, when, being joined by the garrison
of that city, the troops retired leisurely by the
Guadarama Pass on Alba de Tormes. This town, the
Seventy-first occupied from the 7th to the 13th of November,
and during that period sustained a loss in action with
the enemy of 1 sergeant and 6 rank and file killed;
1 bugler and 5 rank and file wounded.</p>

<p>The army having received orders to retire on Portugal,
the battalion abandoned this post, arriving at Coria upon
the 1st of December, where the retreat terminated. In
this quarter, the Seventy-first continued until the 13th of
December, at which time they were pushed forward to
Puerto de Bannos, where they were joined by a draft of
150 men from the second battalion.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1813.</div>

<p>While stationed at this post, an attempt was made, in
February, 1813, by the French, to surprise Bejar, then<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[90]</span>
occupied by the Fiftieth regiment. The Seventy-first were
ordered forward to support, but previously to their arrival
that brave regiment had driven back the enemy and completely
foiled his efforts.</p>

<div class="sidenote">2nd bat.</div>

<p>On the 18th of March, 1813, the second battalion of the
Seventy-first embarked at Gravesend for North Britain,
and arrived at Leith on the 23rd of that month.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1st bat.</div>

<p>Upon the 5th of April, the Seventy-first changed
quarters with the Fiftieth regiment, and continued to
occupy Bejar until the 21st of May, at which period the
army broke up from its winter quarters for active operations.
The battalion on its advance moved by Salamanca and
Toro, and encamped at La Puebla on the 20th of June,
the evening before the memorable battle of Vittoria.</p>

<p>Upon the morning of the 21st of June, the two armies
being in position, the Seventy-first was ordered to ascend
the heights of La Puebla, to support the Spanish forces
under General Morillo. They accordingly advanced in
open column, and having formed line, were immediately
hotly engaged with the enemy, and upon this occasion
suffered an irreparable loss in the fall of their Commanding
Officer the Honourable Colonel Henry Cadogan, who fell
mortally wounded while leading his men to the charge,
and being unable to accompany the battalion, requested
to be carried to a neighbouring eminence, from which he
might take a last farewell of them and the field. In his
dying moments, he earnestly inquired if the French were
beaten, and on being told by an officer of the regiment
who stood by supporting him, that they had given way at
all points, he ejaculated, “God bless my brave countrymen,”
and immediately expired.</p>

<p>While recording the deep sense of sorrow which the
Seventy-first experienced in the loss of a commanding
officer who had so often fought at their head, and whose
devoted gallantry had so frequently called forth their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[91]</span>
admiration, it is but a meet tribute to the memory of that
brave officer to extract from the despatch of the Marquis of
Wellington the following expressions of his Lordship’s
regret at his loss:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“And I am concerned to report that the Honourable
Lieut.-Colonel Cadogan has died of a wound which he
received. In him His Majesty has lost an officer of great
zeal and tried gallantry, who had already acquired the
respect and regard of the whole profession, and of whom
it might be expected that if he had lived he would have
rendered the most important services to his country.”</p>
</div>

<p>After the fall of the Lieut.-Colonel, the Seventy-first
continued advancing, and driving the enemy from the
heights, until the force which was opposed to them became
so unequal, and the loss of the battalion so severe, that it
was obliged to retire upon the remainder of the brigade.
In the performance of this arduous duty, the battalion
suffered very severely, having had 1 field officer, 1 captain,
2 lieutenants, 6 sergeants, 1 bugler, and 78 rank
and file killed; 1 field officer, 3 captains, 7 lieutenants,
13 sergeants, 2 buglers, and 255 rank and file were
wounded.</p>

<p>The officers killed were Colonel the Honourable Henry
Cadogan, Captain Henry Hall, Lieutenants Humphrey
Fox and Colin Mackenzie. Those wounded were Brevet
Lieut.-Colonel Charles Cother, Captains Samuel Reed,
Joseph Thomas Pidgeon, William Alexander Grant, Lieutenants
Alexander Duff, Loftus Richards, John McIntyre,
Charles Cox, William Torriano, Norman Campbell, and
Thomas Commeline.</p>

<p>Lieut.-General Sir William Stuart, on subsequently
receiving the thanks of the House of Commons for his
gallantry at Vittoria, thus recorded the bravery of this
regiment on that day, in the course of his answer to the
Speaker:—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[92]</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I cannot advert to that battle and not submit to the
memory, and, if I may use the term, to the affection of
this House the name of one gallant officer upon whom
the brunt of this contest particularly fell—I mean, Sir,
the late Colonel Cadogan; the fall of that officer was
glorious, as his last moments were marked by the success
of a favourite regiment upon the magnanimity of whose
conduct he kept his eyes fixed during the expiring hour
of a well-finished life.”</p>
</div>

<p>On this occasion the French suffered a great loss of
men, together with all their artillery, baggage, and stores.
King Joseph, whose carriage and court equipage were seized,
had barely time to escape on horseback. The defeat was
the most complete that the French had sustained in the
Peninsula. It was this victory which gained a bâton for
the Marquis of Wellington, who was appointed a Field-Marshal.
In a most flattering letter, the Prince Regent, in
the name and behalf of His Majesty, thus conferred the
honour:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“You have sent me among the trophies of your unrivalled
fame the staff of a French Marshal, and I send
you in return that of England.” This was in allusion to
the bâton of Marshal Jourdon, which was taken by the
Eighty-seventh Regiment at Vittoria.</p>
</div>

<p>The Seventy-first subsequently received the Royal
authority to bear the word “Vittoria” on the regimental
colour and appointments, in commemoration of this signal
victory.</p>

<p>When the Seventy-first paraded on the morning of the
22nd of June, the dreadful havoc made by the action of the
preceding day became painfully manifest, and an universal
gloom was thrown over all, at missing from their ranks
nearly 400 brave comrades who had been either killed or
wounded on the heights of La Puebla.</p>

<p>The enemy having been completely beaten at all points<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[93]</span>
was forced to retreat in confusion on Pampeluna, and the
British army immediately followed in pursuit. The battalion
in this advance arrived at Pampeluna on the 29th of
June, and shortly afterwards followed, as part of Sir Rowland
Hill’s army, a large force of the enemy, who were
retreating into France by the valley of Bastan. During
this forward movement the Seventy-first had some skirmishing
in the valley of Elizondo, but without loss. Upon
the 8th of July the Seventy-first arrived at the heights of
Maya, from whence, for the first time, they had the cheering
prospect of beholding the empire of France extended
under them in all its fertile beauty. Joy was diffused
through every heart: every trial and danger was forgotten
while viewing this splendid and gratifying sight.
Upon these heights the battalion was encamped until the
25th of July.</p>

<p>Marshal Soult having been selected by Napoleon for
the command of the French army in Spain, with the rank
of “Lieutenant of the Emperor,” that officer used the most
active exertions for its re-organization, and made immediate
arrangements for forcing the British position in the
Pyrenees. With this view he advanced in person with a
large force against the right, stationed at Roncesvalles, and
detached Count D’Erlon with about 13,000 men to attack
the position of Maya.</p>

<p>The Count D’Erlon, upon the 25th of July, advanced
against the right of the Maya heights, where the ridges of
the mountains branched off towards his camp. The force
at this point was not sufficient to resist such formidable
numbers, and the reserve being posted at some distance to
watch passes of importance, which could not be left wholly
unguarded, was brought up by battalions as the pressure
increased.</p>

<p>The intrepidity with which these attacks were met, and
the obstinate bravery with which every inch of ground was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[94]</span>
disputed, were obliged at last to yield to overwhelming
numbers; but although the troops were forced to retrograde,
yet in their retreat they took advantage of every
rising ground, and disputed it with the utmost tenacity.
At the commencement of this attack a part of the first
battalion of the Seventy-first Regiment was detached to a
neighbouring high peak, under the command of Major
William Fitzgerald of the Eighty-second Regiment, and
was strengthened by a company of that corps. Lieut.-General
the Honourable Sir William Stewart, in his report
to Lieut.-General Sir Rowland Hill, thus expressed himself
respecting these men:—“I cannot too warmly praise the
conduct of that field officer (Major Fitzgerald) and that
of his brave detachment. They maintained the position
to the last, and were compelled, from the want of ammunition,
to impede the enemy’s occupation of the rock by
hurling stones at them.”</p>

<p>In another part of this communication, the Lieut.-General
thus alluded to the Eighty-second Regiment and
to the first brigade, which was composed of the Fiftieth,
Seventy-first, and Ninety-second Regiments:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I feel it my duty to recommend to your attention, and
favourable report to the Commander of the Forces, the
conduct and spirit of Colonel Grant, and of his brave
corps, the Eighty-second Regiment; also the whole of
the first brigade, than which His Majesty’s army possesses
not men of more proved discipline and courage. The
wounds of him, and every commanding officer in that
brigade, were attended with circumstances of peculiar
honour to each of them, and to those under their
orders.”</p>
</div>

<p>The following is a list of the killed and wounded in the
action of the 25th of July, as nearly as could be ascertained:—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[95]</span></p>

<p>3 sergeants and 54 rank and file killed; 6 sergeants,
1 bugler, and 76 rank and file wounded.</p>

<p>The Seventy-first continued retiring until the 30th,
when Lieut.-General Sir Rowland Hill took up a strong
position beyond Lizasso. In this post he was attacked
with much spirit by the enemy, who at the same time, by
manœuvring on the left flank, rendered necessary a change
of position to a range of heights near Eguaros, which all
the efforts of the French failed to carry. Upon this occasion
the Seventy-first was seriously engaged, and had 1
sergeant and 23 rank and file killed; 2 sergeants, 1 bugler,
and 33 rank and file were wounded.</p>

<p>The enemy having been foiled in all the objects of his
attack found it necessary, in his turn, to retreat, moving on
the 31st of July by the pass of Doña Maria, where he left
a strong corps in an excellent position. This force was
immediately attacked by the columns of Lieut.-Generals
Sir Rowland Hill and the Earl of Dalhousie, and dislodged
after a gallant resistance. In the action of this day
the first brigade, consisting of the Fiftieth, Seventy-first,
and Ninety-second Regiments, had the honour of bearing
its share and of distinguishing itself. The Seventy-first
had 1 sergeant and 29 rank and file killed; 2 sergeants
and 45 rank and file were wounded.</p>

<p>The battalion now returned to the heights of Maya,
from whence, after a halt of a few days, it moved to Roncesvalles.</p>

<p>Previously to this change of quarters, an order was
issued by Lieut.-General Sir Rowland Hill, relative to the
conduct of the troops in the actions of the Pyrenees, of
which the following is a copy:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="right">
“<em>Arrizi, August 3rd, 1813.</em><br>
</p>

<p class="noindent">“<span class="smcap">General Order.</span></p>

<p>“Lieut.-General Sir Rowland Hill requests that the
officers, non-commissioned officers, and privates of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[96]</span>
corps of the army under his command will accept his
best thanks for the gallant conduct they have displayed
during the late active and interesting operations.</p>

<p>“The chance of service has placed the troops under his
command in situations where they were exposed to an
immense superiority of forces, a circumstance unavoidable
in operations so extensive as those in which this army
has been engaged; and it has at all times been necessary
to cede ground to the enemy. The Lieut.-General, however,
has the satisfaction of knowing that the troops have
on every occasion maintained their high character; that
they have only withdrawn from their positions by superior
orders, and then it has been invariably attended with
circumstances highly creditable to them. The Lieut.-General
has not failed to report to the Commander of the
Forces the details of the several affairs in which the corps
have been engaged, and he knows that their services are
duly appreciated by his Excellency.”</p>
</div>

<p>The Royal authority was subsequently granted to the
Seventy-first to bear the word “Pyrenees” on the regimental
colour and appointments, in commemoration of the
services of the first battalion in the actions of the 25th,
30th, and 31st of July, which have been designated the
“<em>Battles of the Pyrenees</em>.”</p>

<p>In these actions the Seventy-first had Lieutenant
Alexander Duff killed, Major Maxwell Mackenzie, Captains
Leslie Walker and Alexander Grant, Lieutenants Thomas
Park, John Roberts, William Woolcombe, William Peacocke,
and Anthony Pack, wounded.</p>

<p>The following “Morning Reports” of the 14th of June
and 7th of August, the former being prior to the battle of
Vittoria, and the latter a few days subsequent to the actions
in the Pyrenees, will show how the ranks of the Seventy-first
were thinned within a period of less than two
months:—</p>

<p>For nearly three months the battalion was encamped
on the heights of Roncesvalles, during which period
St. Sebastian and Pampeluna were captured. The men
were principally employed during this interval in the construction
of block houses and batteries, and the formation
of roads for the artillery.</p>

<p>In the early part of the season the neighbouring heights
of Altobispo were occupied weekly by the brigades of the
division; but as the cold increased with the high winds,
the pickets alone were appointed for this duty. Such was
the inclemency of the weather, and natural advantages of
this position, that it was scarcely thought that the enemy
would attempt an attack. This opinion, however, was ill
founded, as upon the night of the 11th of October an
attempt was made by a strong party upon the advance,
composed of 15 men of the Seventy-first, under Sergeant
James Ross. Instead of flinching from an unequal contest,
this small band, relying upon the strength of the
position, and being, moreover, favoured by the darkness,
which concealed its strength, maintained its ground, and
forced the enemy to retire. The bravery of this party
called forth high praise from Lieut.-General the Honourable
Sir William Stewart, commanding the division, and at
his request the soldiers composing it were all presented
with medals.</p>

<p>On the 8th of November the division was again in
motion, for the purpose of entering the French territory;
and on the 9th of that month it bivouacked near the
heights of Maya, where orders were received to march as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[98]</span>
light as possible. The heights were passed that night by
moonlight for the purpose of joining the grand army; but
the march over bad roads was so fatiguing that when the
brigade arrived in position on the Nivelle it was not called
upon to take an active part in the glorious proceedings of
the rest of the army on the 10th of November, in forcing
the French from their fortified position on that river.</p>

<p>After the battle of the Nivelle, the battalion marched
in the direction of Cambo, on the Nive, where some smart
skirmishing occurred, in which 2 men were killed, and 4
sergeants, 1 bugler, and 41 rank and file wounded. When
the French crossed to the right bank, the Seventy-first
occupied part of the town of Cambo.</p>

<p>The battalion remained in Cambo for nearly a month,
and was here joined by a detachment of 4 sergeants and
82 rank and file, under the command of Lieut. Charles
Henderson, from the second battalion, at this period
stationed at Glasgow.</p>

<p>On the 9th of December the first battalion was engaged
in the passage of the Nive. The left wing of the Seventy-first
entered the river, supported by the fire of the right,
and reached the opposite bank without experiencing any
loss.</p>

<p>The enemy now retired within Bayonne, and the corps
of Lieut.-General Sir Rowland Hill was established with
its right on the Adour, the left above the Nive, and the
centre at St. Pierre, across the high road to St. Jean Pied-de-Port.</p>

<p>In this disposition the second division, of which the
Seventy-first formed part, was placed at St. Pierre. Marshal
Soult, having completely failed in an attempt which
he made against the left of the army, moved with his
whole force against Sir Rowland Hill’s corps, with the
expectation of overwhelming him before he could be supported.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[99]</span></p>

<p>The enemy came on with great boldness upon the 13th
of December, and made vigorous efforts against the centre,
which he repeatedly attacked; but at last, finding his most
earnest endeavours fruitless, he drew off. In the action of
this day the loss of the first battalion of the Seventy-first
was very severe, having been placed close to the main
road, against which the French made such formidable and
repeated attacks.</p>

<p>Brevet Lieut.-Colonel Maxwell Mackenzie and Lieutenants
William Campbell and Charles Henderson, together
with 2 sergeants, 1 bugler, and 23 rank and file, were killed.
Captains Robert Barclay and William Alexander Grant,
and Lieutenants John M<sup>c</sup>Intyre and William Torriano, with
37 rank and file, were wounded.</p>

<p>The following short, but highly expressive Division
Order was issued by Lieut.-General the Honourable Sir
William Stewart, K.B.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="right">
“<em>Head-quarters, near Petite Moguerre,<br>
<span style="margin-right: 3em;">“December 14th, 1813.</span></em><br>
</p>

<p>“The second division has greatly distinguished itself,
and its gallantry in yesterday’s action is avowed by the
Commander of the Forces and the Allied Army.”</p>
</div>

<p>In commemoration of these services, the Seventy-first
subsequently received the royal authority to bear the word
“Nive” on the regimental colour and appointments.</p>

<p>The battalion marched on the 19th of December to
Urcuit, and to Urt upon the 28th of that month. A small
picket of the Seventy-first, under the command of Corporal
Dogherty, here distinguished itself by beating off an
enemy’s party of nearly treble its strength.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1814.</div>

<p>While stationed in this quarter, the companies were
frequently engaged in skirmishes with the enemy, particularly
at St. Hellette, heights of Garris, and St. Palais,
in the month of January, 1814.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[100]</span></p>

<p>In the beginning of February the battalion marched
from Urt, and during its advance had frequent skirmishes
with the enemy’s rear guard.</p>

<p>On the 26th of February the battalion was in action at
Sauveterre, and upon the 27th had the honour of participating
in the battle of Orthes.</p>

<p>In commemoration of this victory, the Seventy-first
afterwards received the royal authority to bear the word
“Orthes” on the regimental colour and appointments.</p>

<p>Two divisions of the French army having retired to
Aire after the action of the 27th of February, Lieut.-General
Sir Rowland Hill moved upon that town to
dislodge them. Upon the 2nd of March the French were
found strongly posted upon a ridge of hills, extending
across the great road in front of the town, having their
right on the Adour. The second division attacked them
along the road, seconded by a Portuguese brigade, and
drove them from their position. Lieut. James Anderson
and 17 rank and file were killed; Lieut. Henry Frederick
Lockyer, 1 sergeant, and 19 rank and file were wounded.</p>

<p>A detachment from the second battalion, consisting of
1 captain, 4 subalterns, and 134 rank and file, under the
command of Major Arthur Jones, joined at Aire.</p>

<p>On the 25th of March, part of the battalion was
engaged in an affair at Tarbes, in which Lieutenant
Robert Law was wounded, and upon the 10th of April
was in position at Toulouse, where some of the companies
were employed skirmishing, and sustained a loss of
1 sergeant and 3 rank and file killed; 6 rank and file
were wounded.</p>

<p>During the night of the 11th of April, the French troops
evacuated Toulouse, and a white flag was hoisted. On
the following day, the Marquis of Wellington entered the
city, amidst the acclamations of the inhabitants. In the
course of the afternoon of the 13th of April, intelligence<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[101]</span>
was received of the abdication of Napoleon, and had not
the express been delayed on the journey by the French
police, the sacrifice of many valuable lives would have been
prevented.</p>

<p>A disbelief in the truth of this intelligence occasioned
much unnecessary bloodshed at Bayonne, the garrison of
which made a desperate sortie on the 14th of April, and
Lieutenant Sir John Hope (afterwards Earl of Hopetoun)
was taken prisoner. Major-General Andrew Hay was
killed, and Major-General Stopford was wounded.</p>

<p>A treaty of peace was established between Great
Britain and France; Louis XVIII was restored to the
throne of France, and Napoleon Bonaparte was permitted
to reside at Elba, the sovereignty of that island having
been conceded to him by the Allied Powers.</p>

<p>The war being ended, the first battalion of the Seventy-first
regiment marched from Toulouse to Blanchfort, where
it was encamped for 16 days, and afterwards proceeded to
Pouillac, where it embarked on the 15th of July for
England, on board of His Majesty’s ship “Sultan” of
seventy-four guns.</p>

<p>Prior to the breaking up of the Peninsula army, the
Duke of Wellington issued the following General Order:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="right">
“<em>Bordeaux, 14th June, 1814.</em><br>
</p>

<p class="noindent">“<span class="smcap">General Order.</span></p>

<p>“The Commander of the Forces, being upon the point
of returning to England, again takes this opportunity of
congratulating the army upon the recent events which
have restored peace to their country and to the world.</p>

<p>“The share which the British army have had in producing
those events, and the high character with which
the army will quit this country, must be equally satisfactory
to every individual belonging to it, as they are to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[102]</span>
the Commander of the Forces, and he trusts that the
troops will continue the same good conduct to the last.</p>

<p>“The Commander of the Forces once more requests
the army to accept his thanks.</p>

<p>“Although circumstances may alter the relations in
which he has stood towards them for some years so much
to his satisfaction, he assures them he will never cease to
feel the warmest interest in their welfare and honour,
and that he will be at all times happy to be of any
service to those to whose conduct, discipline, and gallantry
their country is so much indebted.”</p>
</div>

<p>In addition to the other distinctions acquired during
the war in Spain, Portugal, and the South of France, the
Seventy-first subsequently received the Royal Authority
to bear the word “Peninsula” on the regimental colours
and appointments.</p>

<p>The first battalion arrived at Cork on the 28th of July,
and marched to Mallow, where it remained for a few days.
On the 4th of August, the battalion marched to Limerick,
where Colonel Reynell assumed command of it in December,
and in which city it continued to be quartered during
the remainder of the year.</p>

<div class="sidenote">2nd bat.</div>

<p>The second battalion remained stationed in North
Britain.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1815.</div>

<div class="sidenote">1st bat.</div>

<p>In January, 1815, the first battalion of the Seventy-first
regiment marched from Limerick to Cork, and embarked
as part of an expedition under orders for North America.
Peace having been concluded with the United States, and
contrary winds having prevented the sailing of the vessels,
the destination of the battalion was changed, and subsequent
events occasioned its being employed against its
former opponents. The tranquillity which Europe appeared
to have gained by the splendid successes over
the French in the Peninsula was again to be disturbed.
Napoleon, who had been accustomed to imperial sway,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[103]</span>
was naturally discontented with his small sovereignty of
Elba. Besides, the correspondence kept up by him with
his adherents in France, gave him hopes of regaining his
former power, which were, for a short time, fully realised.
He landed at Cannes in Provence, on the 1st of March,
1815, with a small body of men, and on the 20th of that
month entered Paris at the head of an army which had
joined him on the road. This could not be wondered at,
for the officers and soldiers had won their fame under his
command, and gladly welcomed their former leader, under
whom they probably expected to acquire fresh honours,
which might erase the memory of the defeats sustained in
the Peninsula.</p>

<p>Louis XVIII, unable to stem the torrent, withdrew
from Paris to Ghent, and Napoleon resumed his former
dignity of Emperor of the French. This assumption the
Allied Powers determined not to acknowledge, but resolved
to deprive him of his sovereignty, and again restore the
ancient dynasty.</p>

<p>The first battalion of the Seventy-first, in consequence
of these occurrences, proceeded to the Downs, and was
there embarked on board small vessels, which conveyed it
to Ostend, where it disembarked on the 22nd of April.</p>

<p>The battalion next proceeded to Ghent, and, after remaining
there a week, marched to Leuze, between Ath
and Fournay, and was subsequently placed in the light
brigade with the first battalion of the Fifty-second, six
companies of the second, and two companies of the third
battalion of the Ninety-fifth Regiment (Rifles), under the
command of Major-General Frederick Adam, in the division
of Lieut.-General Sir Henry Clinton.</p>

<p>The strength of the brigade was as follows:—</p>

<p class="noindent">Brevet Colonel Reynell, afterwards Lieut.-General Sir
Thomas Reynell, commanded the battalion at this period.</p>

<p>Napoleon resolved on attacking the Allies before their
forces had been fully collected, and by well-marked and
admirably combined movements, a portion of his army
was concentrated, on the 14th of June, between the Sambre
and the Meuse.</p>

<p>On the morning of the 16th of June, as the battalion
was proceeding to the usual exercising-ground of the
brigade at Leuze, it received orders for an immediate
advance upon Nivelles, where it arrived late that night.
On the same day, Prince Blücher had been attacked at
Ligny, and was forced to retreat to Havre. The Duke of
Wellington and a portion of his army had been also
attacked at Quatre Bras by Marshal Ney, who, however,
made no impression upon the British position.</p>

<p>In the course of the morning of the 17th of June, the
Duke of Wellington made a retrograde movement upon
Waterloo, in order to keep up his communication with
the Prussians. At day-break on the same morning, the
first battalion of the Seventy-first retired, and took up its
position, with the rest of the allied army, on the plains in
the neighbourhood of Waterloo, being situated to the left
and rear of Hougomont.</p>

<p>The Seventy-first, with the rest of the army, bivouacked
in position during the night of the 17th of June, drenched
by the rain, which fell heavily. Upon the morning of the
memorable 18th of June, the battalion stood in open<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[105]</span>
column, and in this situation was exposed for some time
to a heavy fire of artillery, but a judicious movement to a
short distance alleviated in a great measure this annoyance.
Line was next formed, and about two o’clock the
battalion, with the rest of the brigade, advanced, met
their opponents in position, charged, and instantly overthrew
them.</p>

<p>A heavy fire now commenced upon the retreating
enemy, but the alignment having been completely deranged
by the impetuosity of the advance, Colonel Reynell,
with his usual coolness, proceeded to restore order,
and had just completed the dressing of the line when the
French cavalry was seen advancing. Square was instantly
formed, and the Seventy-first, with the rest of the brigade,
sustained a charge from 3 regiments of French cavalry,
namely, 1 of cuirassiers, 1 of grenadiers-à-cheval, and 1
of lancers.</p>

<p>The charge was made with the most obstinate bravery,
but nothing could overcome the steadiness of the British
infantry, and after a destructive loss, the French were
forced to retire. At this moment a piper played up the
Seventy-first quick march, followed with the charge.
Major-General Adams with the regiment exclaimed,
“Well done, Seventy-first; you are all lions together, and
as for you, piper, you are an honour to your country.
Forward, my lads, and give them the charge in style,
as I know and see you can do.”</p>

<p>Previously to this advance of the enemy’s cavalry the
square of the Seventy-first was struck by a round shot,
which killed or wounded an officer and 18 men of the
eighth company.</p>

<p>About seven o’clock in the evening the left wing of the
battalion was formed in rear of the right, and while thus
placed was, with the rest of the division, attacked by a
column of the Imperial Young Guard, which had been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[106]</span>
kept in reserve during the day. It was allowed to approach
close without molestation, when the regiments,
throwing in a close and well-directed fire, prevented its
deployment, and it retired in confusion.</p>

<p>The enemy having now exhausted all its efforts, the
British, in their turn, advanced. The Seventy-first, in the
first instance, suffered much from the fire of some guns
that enfiladed its front; these were soon silenced, and the
battalion was afterwards left unmolested. In this advance
the light brigade captured several guns. Night closed in
fast, and the corps rested after this lengthened and sanguinary
encounter, the pursuit of the discomfited enemy
<ins class="corr" id="tn-106" title="Transcriber’s Note—Original text: 'being commited'">
being committed</ins> to the Prussians, under Marshal Blücher,
who had arrived on the field of battle in time to decide the
defeat of the French.</p>

<p>The Seventy-first had Brevet Major Edmund L’Estrange
(Aide-de-Camp to Major-General Sir Denis Pack, K.C.B.),
and Ensign John Todd, killed. The following officers were
wounded: the Lieut.-Colonel commanding the battalion,
Colonel Thomas Reynell; Brevet Lieut.-Colonel Arthur
Jones; Captains Samuel Reed, Donald Campbell, William
Alexander Grant, James Henderson, and Brevet Major
Charles Johnstone; Lieutenants Joseph Barrallier, Robert
Lind, John Roberts, James Coates, Robert Law, Carique
Lewin, and Lieutenant and Adjutant William Anderson.</p>

<p>The number of serjeants, buglers, and rank and file
killed amounted to 29; 166 were wounded, of whom 36
died of their wounds.</p>

battle:—</p>

<p>Both Houses of Parliament, with the greatest enthusiasm,
voted their thanks to the army for its “distinguished
valour at Waterloo.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[108]</span></p>

<p>For the share which the battalion had in this glorious
victory, the Seventy-first were permitted to bear, in common
with the rest of the army engaged upon the 18th of
June, the word “Waterloo” on the regimental colour and
appointments. Colonel Thomas Reynell and Major L.
Walker were appointed Companions of the Bath. The
officers and men engaged were presented with silver
medals by His Royal Highness the Prince Regent, and
were allowed to reckon two years additional service.</p>

<p>The battalion, with the rest of the army, afterwards
marched towards Paris, and entered that city on the 7th of
July. The brigade encamped that day on the Champs
Elysées, near the Place Louis Quinze, being the only
British troops quartered within the barriers, and continued
there until the beginning of November, when it
proceeded to Versailles, and to Viarmes in December.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Louis XVIII had entered Paris and was
again reinstated on the throne of his ancestors. Napoleon
Bonaparte had surrendered to Captain Maitland, commanding
the “Bellerophon,” British ship of war, and the
island of St. Helena having been fixed for his residence,
he was conveyed thither with a few of his devoted followers.</p>

<p>In Edinburgh, on the 26th of July, at the annual competition
for prizes given by the Highland Society of London,
Sir John Sinclair, President of the Judges, in the
course of his address referred to several instances where
the sound of the bagpipes had been productive of the most
decisive results, and stated that it had been used with the
same effect in the late glorious conflicts, as appeared by
letters from the army. He said that before he obeyed the
directions of the Committee in delivering the prizes it was
necessary to state that George Clark, piper-major to the
Seventy-first Regiment, having formerly received a pipe
from the Highland Society of Scotland for his gallant conduct<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[109]</span>
at the battle of Vimiera in continuing to play upon
his pipes after he was severely wounded, it was thought
proper to vote him a gold medal instead of considering
him as a candidate for one of the prizes.</p>

<div class="sidenote">2nd bat.</div>

<p>On the 24th of December, 1815, the second battalion of
the Seventy-first was disbanded at Glasgow, the effective
officers and men being transferred to the first battalion.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1816.</div>

<p>In January, 1816, the Seventy-first marched to the
Pas-de-Calais, in which part of France the regiment was
quartered in several villages, having its head-quarters at
Norrent Fonte, a village on the high road from Calais to
Douay.</p>

<p>On the 21st of June, 1816, the regiment assembled on
the bruyère of Rombly, between the villages of Lingham
and Rombly on the one side, and Viterness and Leitre on
the other, for the purpose of receiving the medals which
had been granted by His Royal Highness the Prince
Regent to the officers, non-commissioned officers, buglers,
and privates, for their services at the battle of Waterloo.</p>

<p>A hollow square upon the centre was formed on this
occasion; the ranks were opened, and the boxes containing
the medals were placed within the square. Colonel
Reynell then addressed the regiment in the following
manner:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="noindent">“Seventy-first!!</p>

<p>“The deep interest, which you will all give me credit
for feeling, in everything that affects the corps cannot fail
to be awakened upon an occasion such as the present,
when holding in my hands, to transfer to yours, these
honourable rewards bestowed by your Sovereign for your
share in the great and glorious exertions of the army of
His Grace the Duke of Wellington upon the field of
Waterloo, when the utmost efforts of the army of France,
directed by Napoleon, reputed to be the first captain of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[110]</span>
the age, were not only paralyzed at the moment, but
blasted beyond the power of even a second struggle.</p>

<p>“To have participated in a contest crowned with victory
so decisive, and productive of consequences that have diffused
peace, security, and happiness throughout Europe,
may be to each of you a source of honourable pride, as
well as of gratitude to the Omnipotent Arbiter of all
human contests, who preserved you in such peril, and
without whose protecting hand the battle belongs not
to the strong, nor the race to the swift.</p>

<p>“I acknowledge to feel an honest and, I trust, an
excusable, exultation, in having had the honour to command
you on that day, and in dispensing these medals
destined to record in your families the share you had in
the ever memorable battle of Waterloo, it is a peculiar
satisfaction to me that I can present them to those by
whom they have been fairly and honourably earned, and
that I can here solemnly declare that in the course of that
eventful day I did not observe a soldier of this good
regiment whose conduct was not only creditable to the
English nation, but such as his dearest friends could
desire.</p>

<p>“Under such agreeable reflections, I request you to
accept these medals, and to wear them with becoming
pride, as they are incontestable proofs of a faithful discharge
of your duty to your King and your country. I
trust that they will act as powerful talismans to keep you
in your future lives in the paths of honour, sobriety, and
virtue.”</p>
</div>

<p>At the conclusion of the above address the arms were
presented, “God save the King” was played, and the battalion,
by signal, gave three cheers. Colonel Reynell then,
from the lists of companies in succession, called over the
names of those entitled to receive a medal, and with his
own hand placed it in that of the soldier.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[111]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">1817.</div>

<p>New colours were presented to the regiment on the 18th
of January, 1817, by Major-General Sir Denis Pack, K.C.B.,
who made the following address on the occasion:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="noindent">“Seventy-first Regiment!</p>

<p>“Officers, non-commissioned officers, and soldiers, it
affords me the greatest satisfaction, at the request of
your commanding officer, Colonel Reynell, to have the
honour of presenting these colours to you.</p>

<p>“There are many who could perform the office with a
better grace, but there is no one, believe me, who is more
sensible of the merit of the corps, or who is more anxious
for its honour and welfare.</p>

<p>“I might justly pay to the valour and good conduct of
those present the compliments usual on such occasions,
but I had rather offer the expression of my regard and
admiration of that excellent <i lang="fr">esprit de corps</i> and real worth
which a ten years’ intimate knowledge of the regiment
has taught me so highly to appreciate. I shall always
look back with pleasure to that long period in which I
had the good fortune to be your commanding officer, and
during which time I received from the officers the most
cordial and zealous assistance in support of discipline:
from the non-commissioned officers proofs of the most
disinterested regard for His Majesty’s service and the
welfare of their regiment, and I witnessed on the part of
the privates and the corps at large a fidelity to their
colours in South America, as remarkable under such
trying circumstances as their valour has at all times been
conspicuous in the field. I am most happy to think that
there is no drawback to the pleasure all should feel on
this occasion. Your former colours were mislaid after a
fête given in London to celebrate the Duke of Wellington’s
return after his glorious termination of the Peninsula
war, and your colonel, General Francis Dundas, has
sent you three very handsome ones to replace them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[112]</span></p>

<p>“On them are emblazoned some of His Grace’s victories,
in which the Seventy-first bore a most distinguished
part, and more might be enumerated which the corps may
well be proud of. There are still in your ranks valuable
officers who have witnessed the early glories of the regiment
in the East, and its splendid career since is fresh in
the memory of all. Never, indeed, did the character of
the corps stand higher; never was the fame of the British
arms or the glory of the British empire more prominent
than at this moment, an enthusiastic recollection of which
the sight of these colours must always inspire.</p>

<p>“While you have your present commanding officer to
lead you, it is unnecessary for me to add anything to
excite such a spirit; but was I called upon to do so, I
should have only to hold up the example of those who
have fallen in your ranks, and, above all, point to the
memory of that hero who so gloriously fell at your
head.”</p>
</div>

<p>The following appears from the Regimental Records to
be a correct list of the nationalities of the recruits raised
for the regiment between 1804 and 1815:—Scotchmen,
2,560; Irishmen, 1,087; Englishmen, 248; foreigners, 20:
total, 3,915. The following is the list of casualties sustained
by the regiment between 1808 and 1815.</p>

<p>This list is very inaccurate, as no notice is taken in the
Records of the number of men that were killed in skirmishes,
which probably was very considerable. At Corunna
it is stated that several men were killed and wounded, but
the actual number is not given. The number of wounded
at Walcheren is not given:—</p>

<p class="p1">The regiment formed part of the “army of occupation”
in France until towards the end of October, 1818, when it
embarked at Calais for England, and arrived at Dover on
the 29th of that month.</p>

<p>After landing the regiment proceeded immediately to
Chelmsford, where it remained for a short time. During
its stay at this place the establishment was reduced from
810 to 650 rank and file.</p>

<p>On the 25th of November the regiment marched to
Weedon, Derby, and Nottingham, having its head-quarters
at the former place.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1819.</div>

<p>The regiment was inspected at Weedon on the 1st of
May, 1819, by Major-General Sir John Byng, who reported
most favourably to His Royal Highness the Commander-in-Chief
upon its appearance and discipline. In consequence
of this report His Royal Highness was pleased to
dispense with any further inspection of the regiment during
the year.</p>

<p>Whilst stationed at Weedon, Colonel Reynell presented
Sergeant Angus Mackay, Pipe Major, with a highland purse
of white goat-skin handsomely mounted with silver, with
the following inscription richly engraved on a shield:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“From Col. Reynell to Acting-Sergeant Angus Mackay,
Piper in the Seventy-first H.L.I., in testimony of approbation
of his uniform good conduct.”</p>
</div>

<p>On the 21st of June, 1819, the regiment marched to
Chester, having detachments at Liverpool and the Isle of
Man. On August 12th, Colonel Thomas Reynell was
appointed Major-General by brevet.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1820.</div>

<p>In June, 1820, the regiment marched to Rochdale,
Blackburn, and Burnley. In July following it proceeded
to Hertford, Ware, Hoddesdon, and Hatfield; and on the
20th of November it was removed to Canterbury.</p>

<p>Previously to the departure of the regiment from Hertford,
it was inspected by the Adjutant-General to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[115]</span>
Forces, Major-General Sir Henry Torrens, K.C.B., who
communicated to Colonel Sir Thomas Arbuthnot, K.C.B.,
commanding the Seventy-first, the expression of the satisfaction
experienced by His Royal Highness the Commander-in-Chief
in perusing the report made on that occasion.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1821.</div>

<p>In June, 1821, the regiment marched to Chatham,
having detachments at Sheerness, Tilbury Fort, and
Harwich. Here a further reduction took place of 2 companies,
making the establishment to consist of 576 rank
and file.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1822.</div>

<p>From Chatham the regiment marched to London, and
proceeded by the canal to Liverpool, there to embark for
Dublin, where it arrived on the 3rd of May, 1822. The
regiment remained in that city until the beginning of
October, when it marched to the south of Ireland. The
head-quarters were stationed at Fermoy, and detachments
proceeded to the villages of Ballyhooly, Castletown Roche,
Kilworth, Kildorrery, Wattstown, Glanworth, and Mitchelstown.
A subaltern’s party was also encamped at Glennasheen,
in the county of Limerick, the disturbed state of that
part of Ireland requiring detachments in the above posts,
and the utmost exertions of every individual for their protection.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1824.</div>

<p>Lieut.-General Sir Gordon Drummond, G.C.B., was
removed from the colonelcy of the Eighty-eighth to that of
the Seventy-first Regiment, on the 16th of January, 1824,
in succession to General Francis Dundas, deceased.</p>

<p>The regiment remained here for two winters, and in the
beginning of May, 1824, orders were received to march to
the Cove of Cork, to embark for foreign service.</p>

<p>Before the Seventy-first marched to the coast for
embarkation, very gratifying addresses were presented to
Colonel Sir Thomas Arbuthnot, commanding the regiment,
from the magistrates and inhabitants of the district round<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[116]</span>
Fermoy, conveying their approbation of the conduct of the
corps, which had won the esteem of all classes.</p>

<p>A very gratifying order was also issued by Major-General
Sir John Lambert, K.C.B., commanding the south-western
district of Ireland, relative to the conduct of the regiment.
The regiment embarked for North America on the 14th,
16th, 17th, and 18th of May, 1824, on board the Indian
trader “Prince of Orange,” “Cato” and “Fanny” transports,
and anchored at Quebec, on the 23rd, 24th, and 25th
of June.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1825.</div>

<p>In the year 1825, the establishment of the regiment was
augmented from 8 to 10 companies, and formed into
6 <em>service</em> and 4 <em>depôt</em> companies, consisting of 42 sergeants,
14 buglers, and 740 rank and file.</p>

<p>In consequence of this arrangement, the officers and
non-commissioned officers of 2 companies were sent to
England, to join the depôt companies at Chichester.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1826.</div>

<p>The detachments stationed during the summer months
at the posts of Sorel and Three Rivers, rejoined the head-quarters
of the regiment at Quebec, on the 15th of October.</p>

<p>On the 25th of October and the 4th of November the
service companies were inspected by Lieut.-General the
Earl of Dalhousie, the Commander of the Forces in British
North America, who expressed his fullest approbation of
their discipline and interior economy, as well as of their
conduct and appearance.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1827.</div>

<p>The head-quarter division of the Seventy-first embarked
at Quebec for Montreal, on the 17th of May, 1827, after
having been stationed in that garrison nearly three years.
Preparatory to this change of quarters, the service companies
were again inspected by Lieut.-General the Earl of
Dalhousie, who, in orders, assured Lieut.-Colonel Jones that
he had never seen any regiment in more perfect order.</p>

<p>The service companies arrived at Montreal on the 19th<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[117]</span>
of May, and detachments from them were stationed at
Isle-aux-Noix, St. John’s, William Henry, La Chine,
Coteau-du-Lac, and Rideau.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1828.</div>

<p>On the 8th of May, 1828, the Seventy-first embarked
for Kingston in batteaux, and arrived there on the 16th of
that month. It remained stationed here for 12 months.
During the summer and part of the autumn it suffered
much from fever and ague, having had at one period nearly
a third of the men in hospital.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1829.</div>

<p>Upon the 1st of June, 1829, the head-quarters embarked
in a steamboat for York, now called Toronto, the capital
of the Upper Province, and arrived there on the following
morning. One company was detached to Niagara, another
to Amherstburg, and a third to Penetanguishene, on Lake
Huron. A small number of men occupied the naval post
at Grand River, on Lake Erie. The Seventy-first occupied
these posts for a period of two years.</p>

<p>On the 10th of August, 1829, the depôt companies
embarked at Gravesend, for Berwick-on-Tweed.</p>

<p>Major-General Sir Colin Halkett, K.C.B., was removed
from the colonelcy of the Ninety-fifth to that of the Seventy-first
Regiment, on the 21st of September, 1829, in succession
to General Sir Gordon Drummond, G.C.B., who was
appointed to the Forty-ninth Regiment.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1830.</div>

<p>In June, 1830, the depôt companies were removed from
Berwick-on-Tweed to Edinburgh Castle.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1831.</div>

<p>In May, 1831, the service companies moved down to
Quebec, where the whole were assembled on the 16th of
June. After a stay of nearly five months in that city,
orders arrived for them to proceed to Bermuda. They
embarked on the 20th of October, 1831, in the transports
“Layton” and “Manlins,” arriving off St. George’s, Bermuda,
upon the 11th of November, when they immediately
disembarked, sending a detachment of 1 captain, 2 subalterns,
and 120 men to Ireland Island.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[118]</span></p>

<p>The head-quarters were subsequently moved to
Hamilton, and small parties were detached to the signal
posts at Gibbs Hill and Mount Langton.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1833.</div>

<p>During the years 1832 and 1833, the service companies
continued at Bermuda, and the depôt remained in North
Britain. On the 30th of August, 1833, Lieut.-Colonel the
Honourable Charles Grey exchanged from the half-pay to
the Seventy-first Highlanders with Lieut.-Colonel Joseph
Thomas Pidgeon.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1834.</div>

<p>On the 11th of September, 1834, the service companies
embarked at Bermuda for Great Britain, and arrived at
Leith on the 19th of October following. The regiment
was afterwards stationed at Edinburgh, where it remained
during the year 1835. It embarked at Glasgow, on the
11th of May, 1836, for Ireland, and was stationed at<span class="sidenote">1836.</span>
Dublin during the remainder of the year. New colours
were presented to the regiment while at this station, by
the colonel of the regiment, Lieut.-General Sir Colin
Halkett, K.C.B., K.C.H., assisted by the Honourable
Mrs. Grey, wife of the colonel commanding the regiment.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1837.</div>

<p>In June, 1837, the regiment proceeded from Dublin to
Kilkenny.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1838.</div>

<p>Major-General Sir Samuel Ford Whittingham, K.C.B.,
was appointed Colonel of the Seventy-first Highlanders, on
the 28th of March, 1838, in succession to Lieut.-General
Sir Colin Halkett, K.C.B., appointed to the Thirty-first
Regiment.</p>

<p>Meanwhile orders had been received for the regiment to
proceed on foreign service, and on the 20th of April, 1838,
the 6 service companies embarked at Cork, for Canada.
The 4 depôt companies remained in Ireland.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1839.</div>

<p>On the 2nd of June, 1839, the depôt companies embarked
at Cork, for North Britain, and were afterwards stationed
at Stirling.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[119]</span></p>

<p>The establishment of the regiment was augmented on
the 12th of August, 1839, from 740 to 800 rank and file.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1840.</div>

<p>During the year 1840 the service companies were stationed
at St. John’s, Lower Canada. The depôt companies
proceeded from Stirling to Dundee, in April.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1841.</div>

<p>Lieut.-General Sir Thomas Reynell, Bart., K.C.B., was
removed from the colonelcy of the Eighty-seventh Royal
Irish Fusiliers to that of the Seventy-first, on the 15th of
March, 1841, in succession to Lieut.-General Sir Samuel
Ford Whittingham, K.C.B. and K.C.H., deceased.</p>

<p>In May, 1841, the depôt companies proceeded from
Dundee to Aberdeen.</p>

<p>Lieut.-Colonel the Honourable Charles Grey exchanged
to half-pay with Lieut.-Colonel James England, on the 8th
of April, 1842.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1842.</div>

<p>The service companies proceeded from St. John’s to
Montreal in two divisions, on the 27th and 28th of April,
1842.</p>

<p>In consequence of the augmentation which took place
in the army at this period, the Seventy-first Highland
Light Infantry was ordered to be divided into two battalions,
the six service companies being termed the first
battalion, and the depôt, augmented by two new companies,
being styled the reserve battalion. The depôt was accordingly
moved from Stirling to Chichester, and after receiving
about 350 volunteers from other corps, was there organised
into a battalion for foreign service. Nearly all these volunteers
were English and Irish, who were allowed to join the
regiment notwithstanding the protestations of the commanding
officer, who requested that none but Scotchmen
should be allowed to volunteer. The nationality of the
regiment was thereby unnecessarily destroyed for many
years.</p>

<p>The reserve battalion of the Seventy-first, under the
command of Lieut.-Colonel James England, embarked at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[120]</span>
Portsmouth in Her Majesty’s troop ship “Resistance,”
which sailed for Canada on the 13th of August, 1842, and
the battalion landed at Montreal on the 23rd of September,
where the first battalion was likewise stationed, under
the command of Major William Denny, who, upon the
arrival of Lieut.-Colonel England, took charge of the
reserve battalion.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1843.</div>

<p>The reserve battalion marched from Montreal to
Chambly on the 5th of May, 1843, and arrived there on
the same day.</p>

<p>The first battalion, under the command of Lieut.-Colonel
England, embarked at Quebec for the West
Indies in the “Java” transport, on the 20th of October,
1843. The head-quarters disembarked at Grenada on the
15th of December following.</p>

<p>It is a circumstance worthy of record that all the men
of the first battalion who were married without leave were
replaced by volunteers from the reserve battalion, thereby
preventing the separation and consequent misery of those
families, and that all permanent volunteers for Canada,
and old soldiers who were permitted from general good
character to remain in the colony after discharge, or who
were found unfit for service in a tropical climate, were
replaced by volunteers from the reserve battalion.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1844.</div>

<p>The head-quarters of the first battalion embarked on
the 25th of December, 1844, at Grenada, for Antigua.
Lieut. Francis P. Stewart Mackenzie died of yellow fever
at Grenada, on the 21st of December, much regretted by
his brother officers.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1845.</div>

<p>During the year 1845 the head-quarters of the first
battalion continued at Antigua.</p>

<p>The head-quarters and three companies of the reserve
battalion marched from Chambly on the 11th of May,
1845, and arrived at Kingston, in Canada, on the 14th of
that month.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[121]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">1846.</div>

<p>On the 18th of April, 1846, the head-quarters and four
companies of the first battalion embarked at Antigua, on
board the transport “Princess Royal,” and landed at Barbadoes
on the 24th of the same month.</p>

<p>The first battalion, under the command of Captain
Nathaniel Massey Stack, embarked for England at Barbadoes
on the 29th and 31st of December, on board of Her
Majesty’s ship “Belleisle.” During this tour of service in
the West Indies, which lasted just three years, 1 officer,
8 sergeants, and 124 rank and file died of fever and
dysentery.</p>

<p>On the 6th of October, 1846, the reserve battalion left
Kingston, in Canada West, and the head-quarters arrived
at La Prairie on the 8th of that month.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1847.</div>

<p>The ship “Belleisle,” having the first battalion on
board, sailed for Portsmouth on the 1st of January, 1847,
and arrived at Spithead on the 25th of that month. After
disembarking at Portsmouth, the battalion proceeded to
Winchester, where it was stationed until the 19th of July,
when it was conveyed in three divisions by railway to
Glasgow, and on the 21st of December it was removed to
Edinburgh.</p>

<p>In September, 1847, the head-quarters of the reserve
battalion were removed from La Prairie to Chambly, and
in October proceeded to St. John’s, in Canada East.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1848.</div>

<p>Lieutenant-General Sir Thomas Arbuthnot, K.C.B.,
was removed from the colonelcy of the Ninth Foot to that
of the Seventy-first Highlanders on the 18th of February,
1848, in succession to Lieut.-General Sir Thomas Reynell,
Bart. and K.C.B., deceased.</p>

<p>Three companies of the first battalion proceeded from
Edinburgh to Dublin on the 27th of April, 1848, and the
head-quarters, with the three remaining companies, were
removed to Dublin on the 1st of May. In June the head-quarters
were removed to Naas.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[122]</span></p>

<p>During the year 1848, the head-quarters of the reserve
battalion remained at St. John’s, in Canada East.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1849.</div>

<p>Lieut.-General Sir James Macdonell, K.C.B. and
K.C.H., was appointed from the Seventy-ninth to be
Colonel of the Seventy-first on the 8th of February, 1849,
upon the decease of Lieut.-General Sir Thomas Arbuthnot,
K.C.B.</p>

<p>In compliance with instructions received upon the
occasion of Her Majesty’s visit to Dublin, the head-quarters
of the first battalion, with the effectives of three
companies, proceeded from Naas to that garrison on the
28th of July, and were encamped in the Phœnix Park.
The three detached companies also joined at the encampment
on the same day. On the 13th of August the head-quarters
and three companies returned to Naas.</p>

<p>The head-quarters and two companies of the reserve
battalion, under the command of Lieut.-Colonel Sir Hew
Dalrymple, Bart., proceeded from St. John’s to Montreal,
in aid of the civil power, on the 28th of April, 1849. The
head-quarters and three companies quitted Montreal, and
encamped on the island of St. Helen’s on the 30th of
June, but returned to St. John’s on the 16th of July. On
the 17th of August, 1849, the head-quarters and two companies
proceeded from St. John’s to Montreal in aid of the
civil power, and returned to St. John’s on the 6th of September.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1850.</div>

<p>In April, 1850, the first battalion proceeded from Naas
to Dublin.</p>

<p>The head-quarters and two companies of the reserve
battalion quitted St. John’s and Chambly on the 21st of
May, 1850, and arrived at Toronto on the 23rd of that
month, where the battalion was joined by the other companies,
and it continued there during the remainder of the
year.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1851.</div>

<p>In April, 1851, the first battalion proceeded from Dublin<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[123]</span>
to Mullingar, and in July following was removed to Newry,
under the command of Lieut.-Colonel William Denny.</p>

<p>During the year 1851, the reserve battalion continued
to be stationed at Toronto.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1852.</div>

<p>In May, 1852, the reserve battalion proceeded from
Toronto to Kingston. On the 8th of June following,
Lieut.-Colonel Sir Hew Dalrymple, Bart., retired from
the service by the sale of his commission, and was succeeded
by Lieut.-Colonel Nathaniel Massey Stack.</p>

<p>In August the first battalion moved to Kilkenny, sending
detachments to New Ross and Wexford.</p>

<p>On the 1st of November orders were received from the
Horse Guards by the first battalion to hold itself in readiness
for embarkation for the Mediterranean.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1853.</div>

<p>On the 3rd of January it received new colours, shortly
after which it moved to Cork. Soon after the arrival of
the first battalion at Cork, the old colours were placed over
a tablet erected at Kinsale to the memory of the late
Lieut.-General Sir Thomas Arbuthnot, a native of that
place, who commanded the regiment for many years.</p>

<p>During the months of February and March the first
battalion embarked in three freight ships for Corfu. By a
War Office Letter of 20th February, 1854, the first battalion
was augmented from the 1st April by 1 pipe major
and 5 pipers. In May, 1853, the reserve battalion proceeded
to Quebec, and was quartered in the Citadel. After the
embarkation of the first battalion, the depôt proceeded to
Chatham.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1854.</div>

<p>The reserve battalion embarked at Quebec on the
20th September, landed in England on the 13th of
October, and proceeded to Canterbury, where it was
shortly afterwards joined by the depôt from Chatham.
On its departure from Canada, 100 men volunteered to

<p>The English and Irish were all, with the exception of
boys from the Military Colleges, the remains of the volunteers
who joined the reserve battalion in 1842. On the
24th of November, all the effectives of the reserve battalion,
consisting of 1 major, 3 captains, 6 subalterns, 1
assistant surgeon, 20 sergeants, 6 buglers, and 391 rank
and file, embarked at Portsmouth on board the line-of-battle
ship “Royal Albert,” for the Crimea, and landed
at Balaclava on the 20th of December, where it was
kept, sending frequent working parties to the front. The
reserve battalion thus had six weeks’ home service after
being twelve years abroad.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1855.</div>

<p>The first battalion embarked at Corfu for the Crimea
on board the transport “Medway” on the 26th January,
1855, and landed at Balaclava on the 7th of February.
On the 13th the first and reserve battalions were amalgamated
into one battalion of eight companies, about 900
strong, of all ranks. It remained at Balaclava till the
3rd of May, when it embarked on board the “Furious”
and “Gladiator” steam frigates, forming part of the first
expedition to Kertch, which, however, was recalled without
accomplishing its object. The regiment was disembarked
on the 8th of May, and marched to the front, joining
the third brigade of the fourth division, and serving in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[125]</span>
the trenches. It was re-embarked on board the frigates
“Sidon” and “Valorous” on the 22nd of May, and proceeded
to Kertch with the expeditionary force of the
Allied army. The whole landed at Kamish Burnu (about
five miles from Kertch), under cover of the gunboats,
bivouacked that night, and proceeded the next day, marching
through Kertch to Yenikale, where it encamped. The
regiment re-embarked at Yenikale on the 10th of June, on
board the steam frigates “Sidon” and “Valorous,” to
return to Sebastopol, but was again disembarked on the
12th, the head-quarters and right wing remaining at
Yenikale, and the left wing proceeding to Cape St. Paul,
to protect those points in conjunction with a French and
Turkish force.</p>

<p>In the beginning of August a draft of 120 men, under
Captain Rich, disembarked at Balaclava, and marched to
the front. It was attached to the Highland division,
being occasionally employed in the trenches. At the end
of September it embarked for Yenikale, and joined the
head-quarters on the 2nd of October. On the 24th of September
three companies, under Major Hunter, crossed the
Straits of Yenikale, in conjunction with a French force, to
Taman, where a large quantity of hutting material and fuel
was obtained. The expedition returned to Kertch on the
3rd of October.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1856.</div>

<p>The strength and composition of the regiment on the
1st of January was as follows, exclusive of a depôt at Malta,
which was about 100 strong:—</p>

<p>The head-quarters and six companies, under Colonel
Ready, remained in Yenikale, having two companies on
detachment, under Major Campbell, at Kertch, till the 30th
of May, when the head-quarters moved into Kertch, which
was handed over to the Russian authorities on the 22nd of
June. On the same day the head-quarters and six companies
embarked on board the steam ship “Pacific,” and
two under Major Campbell, in the steam ship “Edina,”
and disembarked at Malta on the 29th of June.</p>

<p>The Highland brigade having been kept in reserve
during the war, had few casualties in proportion to other
regiments. The Seventy-first had only 2 men killed, 6
wounded, and 1 taken prisoner. Major K. Hunter, Lieut.
Northey, Assistant-Surgeon Gilborne, and about 100 non-commissioned
officers and men died of sickness. The
regiment whilst stationed at Malta occupied the Floriana,

<p>On the 26th of November, a draft of 2 officers and 41
men joined the head-quarters from the depôt.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1858.</div>

<p>On the evening of the 2nd of January, 1858, the regiment
received orders by telegram to proceed overland to
India. The head-quarters and six companies, under Lieut.-Colonel<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[127]</span>
Campbell, embarked on board the line-of-battle
ship “Princess Royal,” on the 4th, 36 hours later, and disembarked
at Alexandria on the 18th. Two companies,
under Major Hope, which proceeded in Her Majesty’s ship
“Vulture,” disembarked there a few days previously. The
regiment then proceeded in two divisions, by railway, to a
place half way between Cairo and Suez, where they were
mounted on donkeys, and proceeded to Suez, a distance of
about 20 or 25 miles. Owing to the smallness of the donkeys,
and the size of many of the men, most of them preferred
marching to riding. The head-quarters and right
wing, under command of Lieut.-Colonel Campbell, arrived
at Bombay on the 6th of February, and proceeded to
Mhow by bullock train in several detachments, the last of
which arrived on the 17th of March. The whole marched
from Mhow on the 30th of March, to join the Central India
Field Force, under Major-General Sir Hugh Rose, K.C.B.
They joined the second brigade at Moti on the 3rd of May,
were present at the action of Koonch on the 7th of May,
the actions at Muttra and Deapoora on the 16th and 17th
of May, action at Golowlee on the 22nd of May, occupation
of Calpee on the 23rd of May. This wing was also present at
the action of Morar on the 16th of June, on which occasion
Lieut. Wyndham Neave, 1 sergeant, 1 corporal, and 2 privates
were killed and 8 privates wounded. Private George
Rodgers was granted the Victoria Cross for distinguished
conduct and courage on this occasion. Lieut.-Colonel
Campbell, Major Rich, and Lieut. Scott were especially
mentioned.</p>

<p>On the 19th and 20th the whole force, in conjunction
with Brigadier Smith’s column, took possession of Gwalior.
Great sufferings from the excessive heat were undergone
by the Central India Force, all the actions having taken
place in the two hottest months of an Indian summer. To
avoid the excessive power of the sun, the marches were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[128]</span>
always, when practicable, conducted at night, but owing to
the heat and the plague of flies, but little rest could be got
in the daytime, the thermometer in the tents generally
standing at 120°. About 50 men of the regiment died of
sunstroke on the march, and many died soon after arrival
at Morar from utter exhaustion and weakness.</p>

<p>After the capture of Gwalior the regiment returned to
Morar, where it was stationed till the 12th of August, when
it returned to Gwalior, and was stationed at the Lashkar
and Phaol Bagh, and returned again to Morar on the 6th<span class="sidenote">1859.</span>
of June, 1859. On the 11th of November a small field
force, under Lieut.-Colonel Rich, Seventy-first, including a
detachment of the Seventy-first, went out into the jungle
to look for the rebel forces, and defeated them at Ranode
and at Nainwass, on which last occasion 3 privates were
killed. This detachment returned to Gwalior on the 27th
of May, 1859.</p>

<p>The left wing, which had arrived at Bombay on the 8th
of February, started on the 11th of March for Mhow, and
arrived there on the 17th of April. On the 9th of June a
company was sent to Indore. On the 2nd of September
the whole of the detachment in Mhow marched with a
field force under command of Major-General Michel, C.B.,
in pursuit of the rebels, under their celebrated leader
Tantia Topee. It was present at the actions at Rajghur,
15th of September, Mongrowlee, 9th of October (on which
occasion 1 private was killed), Sindwaho, 19th of October,
and Koorai, 25th of October, and afterwards marched to
Goonah, where it arrived on the 17th January, 1859. On the
25th of November a party of 50 men, mounted on camels,
left Mhow with a small column, under command of Major
Sutherland, Ninety-second Highlanders, and was engaged
with the rebels at Rajpore on the 25th November, when the
latter were defeated, after which they returned to Mhow.</p>

<p>On the 1st of January, 1859, the company which had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[129]</span>
been stationed at Indore marched to join a column under
Brigadier-General Sir Robert Napier, K.C.B., and was
present at the attack on the fort of Nahargurh on the 17th
of January, on which occasion 2 privates were severely
wounded. Captain F. W. Lambton, in command of the
company, was specially mentioned for his daring attack, for
which service he was subsequently granted a brevet-majority.
Two companies joined head-quarters from Goonah,
in June, leaving a detachment of three companies there.</p>

<p>The head-quarters were inspected on the 2nd of December,
1859, by the Commander-in-Chief, Lord Clyde. His
Excellency was pleased to express his satisfaction, both at
what he himself saw, and at the reports which he had
received regarding the state of the regiment from other
sources. The report of His Excellency to His Royal
Highness the General Commanding-in-Chief produced the
following letter from the Adjutant-General of the Forces.</p>

<p>The three companies on detachment at Goonah rejoined
head-quarters on the 19th of December, and the regiment,
after being broken up into detachments for two years, was
brought together again.</p>

<p>In the month of December Colonel R. D. Campbell
died in London, and the command of the regiment devolved
on Colonel W. Hope, C.B.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1860.</div>

<p>On the 22nd of July cholera broke out in the regiment,
and in spite of every sanitary measure being taken, did not
finally disappear till the 16th of September, during which
time it carried off 1 colour sergeant, 2 sergeants, 66 rank
and file, 11 women, and 11 children. It is worthy of
remark that during this time only 1 officer was slightly
attacked.</p>

<p>On the 20th of December, the regiment having been
relieved by the Twenty-seventh <ins class="corr" id="tn-130" title="Transcriber’s Note—Original text: 'Enniskeillens'">
Enniskillens</ins>, marched to
Sealkote, in the Punjab. The state of discipline of the
regiment whilst at Gwalior can be gathered from the
following official reports:—</p>

<p>Extract from a Report from the Political Agent at
Gwalior to the Government of India, dated 15th June,
1859:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“When it was determined in June last to post a British
force at the Laskar, the people expected with dread and
deprecation a violent and dangerous, at the least a rude
and overbearing, soldiery; but Her Majesty’s Seventy-first
Highlanders soon falsified their expectations, and
created new feelings. His Highness and the best informed
men of the Durbar have assured me that those
soldiers, who passed ten months in the Phoolbagh,
have by their manners, habits, dealings, and whole
demeanour so conciliated the respect and regard of all,
that nothing could be more acceptable than the domestication
of such a force in the capital. The Durbar<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[131]</span>
further considers that it would bring to Gwalior incalculable
industrial advantages, through affording a constant
supply of superintendents of public works and
skilled labour. I venture to express the hope that His
Excellency may consider the Durbar’s view of the conduct
of Her Majesty’s Seventy-first Highlanders, commanded
by Colonel Campbell, C.B., a very high and
true compliment, as worthy of express recognition as
good conduct in the field. It is, in my humble judgment,
a most fully deserved compliment.</p>

<p class="noindent">of which 790 were Presbyterians, 67 Church of England,
and 128 Roman Catholics. A draft of 130 men on its
way to India is not included. The proportion of English
and Irish in the regiment at this time was less than in any
other Highland regiment.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1862.</div>

<p>The regiment remained stationed at Sealkote till the
1st of November, 1862, when, having been relieved by the
Ninety-third Highlanders, it marched to Nowshera, where
it arrived on the 21st of November, detaching one company
to Attock.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1863.</div>

<p>The regiment remained at Nowshera till the 14th of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[133]</span>
October, 1863, when, in accordance with instructions received
from head-quarters, it marched to Nawakilla, in the
Yusufzai country, leaving all sick men and invalids behind
at Nowshera. The force which was assembled at Nawakilla
for service in the hill country was under the command
of Brigadier-General Sir Neville Chamberlain, K.C.B.
The object of the expedition was to destroy Mulka, on the
Mahaban Mountain, the stronghold of certain Hindoostanee
fanatics, generally known as the “Sitana” fanatics, who
infested our frontiers, and were incessantly attacking the
villages in our territory. Mulka is just beyond the
English frontier, and in the territory of the Indoons. The
force marched in two divisions; the first, entirely composed
of native troops, marched on the 18th; the second, composed
of European troops, marched on the 20th. The
Umbeylah Pass was seized without difficulty, but, owing
to the bad road, the march, although a comparatively
short one, lasted nearly 24 hours, and several days passed
before all the guns and baggage were brought up. On
the 21st the regiment encamped near the village of
Umbeylah. On the 26th of October, 150 men of the
Seventy-first, under Major Parker, were engaged in repelling
an attack from the enemy, on which occasion 1
private was killed and 5 were wounded. Privates William
Clapperton and George Stewart were recommended for
the medal for service in the field on this occasion. On the
30th the enemy made another attack on the pickets, but
were repulsed. The Seventy-first had 3 privates wounded
on this occasion. On the 6th November a party of the
regiment was attacked by the enemy, having been sent too
far to the front, and not properly supported. Ensign
C. B. Murray, Lieut. Dougal, Seventy-ninth, attached, 1
sergeant, and 3 privates were killed, and 4 privates were
wounded. Captain Mounsey and Lieut. Davidson, the
latter of the Indian Army attached to the Seventy-first,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[134]</span>
were specially mentioned for their gallantry on this
occasion. On the 18th the whole force changed position
to higher ground, and was immediately attacked by the
enemy, who was not repulsed before night. On this occasion
Captain C. T. Smith, Lieut. Gore Jones, of the
Seventy-ninth Highlanders, doing duty with the Seventy-first,
and 4 privates, were killed, 1 sergeant and 4
privates were wounded. Major Parker was specially
mentioned for his services. On the 19th Captain Aldridge
and 1 private were killed; 1 private was wounded. On
the 20th, the enemy, having succeeded in driving out
the 101st Fusiliers from the “Crag Picket,” by a sudden
and unexpected attack, the Seventy-first were ordered
up to retake it. The “Crag Picket” was situated at
the top of a very rocky hill, which rendered the operation
doubly difficult. Led by Colonel W. Hope, C.B., who
was severely wounded, and supported by two native corps,
the Seventy-first, in spite of the natural obstacles and the
determined resistance of the enemy, retook the “Crag
Picket” at the point of the bayonet. The loss on this
occasion was 7 privates killed, 1 field officer, 2 sergeants.
3 corporals, and 19 privates wounded. On the 27th, 1
private was killed. On the 15th of December Major-General
<ins class="corr" id="tn-134" title="Transcriber’s Note—Original text: 'Garvoch, commanding'">
Garvock, commanding</ins> the Peshawur division, had
succeeded Sir N. Chamberlain in the command of the
whole force, when the latter was wounded on the 20th of
November. Having received strong reinforcements, he
attacked and defeated the enemy on all points. The regiment,
being on picket duty, was not engaged on this occasion.
Shortly after the Boneyrs asked for and obtained
terms of peace. The regiment returned to Nonshera on
the 30th December.</p>

<p>The following was the loss sustained by the regiment
in the Umbeylah Pass. 5 officers (including Lieutenants
Dougal and Jones of the Seventy-ninth attached), 1 sergeant,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[135]</span>
and 17 privates killed; 1 officer, 4 sergeants, and 42
privates wounded.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1864.</div>

<p>On the 4th of January the regiment marched for
Peshawur, where it arrived on the 5th. On the 21st of
January it was inspected by His Excellency Sir Hugh
Rose, K.C.B., who expressed himself in the most complimentary
manner with reference to the conduct of the regiment
in the late campaign. The three men whose names
had appeared in General Orders, Privates William Malcolm,
William Clapperton, and George Stewart, were called
to the front, and were addressed by His Excellency in
terms of approval of their gallant conduct in the presence
of the enemy. On the 23rd of October the regiment
commenced its march for Calcutta prior to embarkation
for England. At Rawal Pindee it was called upon to give
volunteers for the other regiments in the Bengal Presidency.
200 men volunteered, and were transferred accordingly.
At Umbala, on the 14th of December, at a general
parade of the garrison, medals for “gallant conduct in the
field” were presented by Major-General Lord George
Paget, commanding the Sirhind division, to Sergeant-Major
John Blackwood, Privates William Malcolm, William
Macdonald, William Clapperton, and George Stewart.
Sergeant-Major J. Blackwood, who had been dangerously
wounded, was also granted an annuity of £15 a year, and
was shortly afterwards invalided on account of his wound.
He has since been appointed one of Her Majesty’s Yeomen
of the Guard and Sergeant-Major of the Second Royal
Lanark Militia.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1865.</div>

<p>On the 4th of February the head-quarters and right
wing under Colonel Hope, C.B., embarked at Calcutta;
the left wing, under Major Gore, embarked on the 14th of
February.</p>

<p>The right wing arrived at Plymouth on the 29th of May,
and shortly afterwards proceeded to Edinburgh Castle,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[136]</span>
where it was joined by the left wing, which disembarked at
Gravesend on the 19th of June.</p>

<p>The following divisional and general orders were published
before the regiment left India:—</p>

<p>“The Seventy-first Highland Light Infantry being
about to leave the Peshawur Division <i lang="fr">en route</i> for
England, the Major-General desires to offer them his best
wishes on the occasion. He has known the regiment for
a number of years. He was very intimately associated
with it in the Mediterranean, and his interest in it is now
materially increased in no small degree by its having
served under him in the field, and done its part, and done
it well, in obtaining for him those honours which Her
Majesty has been pleased to confer. The Major-General
had not assumed command of the Yusufzai Field Force
when the Seventy-first recaptured the ‘Crag Picket,’
but he well knows it was a most gallant exploit. Sir
John Garvock, K.C.B., begs Colonel Hope, C.B., and the
officers, non-commissioned officers, and soldiers of the
Seventy-first Light Infantry to believe that although
they will be soon no longer under his command, he will
continue to take the liveliest interest in their career, and
he now wishes them a speedy and prosperous voyage.</p>

Infantry in India entitle them, on their departure to
England, to honourable mention in general orders. A
wing of the regiment, on their arrival in India in 1858,
joined the Central India Field Force, and His Excellency
is enabled to bear testimony to the good services
which they performed, and the excellent spirit which
they displayed during that campaign. The regiment
more recently distinguished itself under their Commanding

on the frontier. Sir Hugh Rose cannot, in justice to
military merit, speak of the Seventy-first in a general
order without reverting to an earlier period, when in two
great campaigns in Europe they won a reputation which
has earned them an honourable page in history.</p>

<p>The losses of the regiment during the seven years it
was quartered in India were Captain W. F. Smith, Captain
R. B. Aldridge, Lieut. Wyndham Neave, and Ensign
C. B. Murray, 2 sergeants and 24 rank and file killed, 1
officer, Colonel W. Hope, C.B., 4 sergeants, and 50 rank
and file wounded. Major H. Loftus, Lieut. and Adjutant
Cowburn, Ensign Swainson, and Surgeon W. Simpson,
and about 250 men, died of disease. About a half of the
loss incurred by disease occurred during the six weeks that
the Central India campaign lasted, and during the six
weeks that the cholera was raging in the regiment in 1860.</p>

<p>The depôt companies joined the regiment in Edinburgh,
and the establishment of the regiment was fixed at 12
companies, with 54 sergeants, 31 buglers and pipers, and
700 rank and file.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[138]</span></p>

<p>In October occurred the death of Brevet Lieut.-Colonel
Parker, of typhoid fever, after a service of 23 years in the
regiment.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1866.</div>

<p>In February, authority was received from the Commander-in-Chief
for the officers of the regiment to wear
a sword with a cross hilt instead of a basket hilt on all

<p>In the same month the regiment embarked at Granton,
<ins class="corr" id="tn-138" title="Transcriber’s Note—Original text: 'for Aldershott'">
for Aldershot</ins>, where it arrived on the 19th, and remained
stationed there till December, when it proceeded to Portsmouth,
and embarked on board Her Majesty’s ship
“Tamar” for Ireland, where it arrived on the 14th. The
head-quarters and five companies proceeded to Fermoy,
detaching three companies to Cork and two to Ballincollig.
During the whole of this year, when a Fenian outbreak
was anticipated, the regiment was much broken up into
detachments, having at different times sent detachments to
the following places:—Cork, Ballincollig, Mallow, Millstreet,
Dungarvan, Mitchelstown, Tralee, Limerick, Killarney,
and Rathkeale. On the 27th of November Colonel
W. Hope, C.B., retired on half-pay, after a service of 32
years in the regiment, and after having commanded it for
eight years, much and deservedly respected and regretted
by all ranks. The command now devolved on Major J. J.
Macdonell.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1868.</div>

<p>The regiment proceeded to Dublin on the 30th April,
1868, at which time its establishment was increased to 800
privates. On the 22nd of July the regiment proceeded to
the Curragh Camp, and remained there till the 17th of
October, when it embarked on board Her Majesty’s ship
“Simoom” for Gibraltar, where it arrived on the 22nd of
the same month.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1869.</div>

<p>On the 1st of April the establishment of the regiment
was reduced by 100 privates.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1870.</div>

<p>On the 31st of March the regiment sustained the loss<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[139]</span>
by death of Lieut.-General the Honourable C. Grey, the
Colonel of the regiment. General Grey had previously
commanded the regiment from 1833 to 1842, and had
always taken the greatest interest in its welfare. He was
succeeded by Lieut.-General R. Law, K.H., who in the
earlier part of his military career had served in the Seventy-first
during the whole of the war in Spain, having been
present with the regiment at all the actions in which it was
engaged, and having been wounded several times. He was
also severely wounded by a cannon ball at the battle of
Waterloo, whilst performing the duties of adjutant. On
the 1st of April the establishment of the regiment was
reduced from 12 to 10 companies.</p>

<p>According to a return furnished to the Horse Guards in
1872, the Seventy-first proved to be the most national one
among the Highland corps, the numbers being 710 Scotch,
25 English, and 18 Irish.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1873.</div>

<p>By general order dated 17th March, 1873, the regiment
was associated with the Seventy-eighth Highlanders
(Ross-shire Buffs), and formed into the Fifty-fifth Brigade,
together with the Ross, Caithness, &amp;c., and Inverness,
Nairn, and Elgin militia regiments, with its depôt established
permanently at Fort George.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1874.</div>

<p>On the 24th of April the service companies embarked
on board Her Majesty’s ship “Tamar,” for passage to
Malta, where they disembarked on the 30th of the same
month.</p>

<p>On the 10th of May the death of Lieut.-General Law
took place. He was succeeded in the command of the
regiment by Lieut.-General the Honourable G. Cadogan,
who was transferred from the 106th at his own request.
General Cadogan is nephew of Lieut.-Colonel the Honourable
H. Cadogan, who commanded the regiment throughout
the whole of the Peninsular war, and was finally killed at
the battle of Vittoria.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[140]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">1876.</div>

<p>The regiment still remains quartered at Malta. The
composition and nationality of the regiment at the present
date is as follows:—</p>

displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>

Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
